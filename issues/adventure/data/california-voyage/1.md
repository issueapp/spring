So who is Peter Jamus and what is he doing differently than last year? ‘I’m finding more purpose and meaning in my work; I had started to loose that working with clients,’ Peter explained when asked what he was focusing on in the next year.  For him, that also means owning a body of work that fully summarizes him and his point of view.

> This year I want to focus on personal expression. Closing off the space between the art and the audience.

Self described as an adventure photographer, Peter admits that a lot of his favorite images from his collection are ‘stolen moments,’ which he describes as ‘photos from an adventure, where nothing is staged.’ This is evidenced in his uncanny ability to capture emotion with a single finger or feather.

### California Voyage

Peter recently went on a voyage along the California Coast to explore this concept of adventure photography. This voyage had an official name, and a hashtag (#LAFG). Peter hopped in an RV with some of his photographer friends from Flickr and headed west to adventure through different Californian landscapes to make and create and build community around entrepreneurial artistry. A lot of the artists at the LA Flickr Gathering are 100% supported by their work, and Peter is looking to achieve that in the next year.

One challenge that Peter faced on this adventure was an assignment that required the artists to preconceive work. Peter explained that the photographers arrived at the beach destination with props and elaborate ideas. “It was hard for me. Pre-visions are stifling…people had props, all these ideas, just floating around.’ Instead, Peter hung out by himself drawing letters in the sand, noticing much later that he was drawing the letters “A,” “R,” “T”. He recalls his fellow photographers who were running around with their props and their sets asking ‘What are you making?’ ‘Art,’ Peter responded. It was ‘the expression I needed then to move forward.’ Feeling disconnected from the assignment to prefabricate art, Peter, who rarely takes self-portraits, set up his tripod.  He related this experience of holding handfuls of sand and letting them sift through his fingertips to his newfound philosophy of art-creation. “This is the purest art form—no matter what, it will fade.’ And yet it was such a significant moment for him during his adventure. A very meaningful conclusion was born: ‘I want art to find me. I don’t think I am there yet.’
