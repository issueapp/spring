It’s hard to describe what Iceland is truly like without having words fail me. It’s as about as far away as I can be from home, yet as soon as I touched down, I felt an overwhelming sense of calm wash over me. As if to suggest that I had, indeed, found home in this city so beautiful it could move me to tears (and it did).     

Here’s my (mini) guide to Iceland. I hope it’s useful to anyone planning to visit soon.
