There is something exciting about the thought of embarking on uncharted expeditions-- whether literal or figurative. I excited for changes in the way I experience things and how I learn and grow from them.
 
‘How is this going to be better?’ We have an answer: Get Adventurous. Whatever that means for you. The literal definition of adventure is ‘an exciting or very unusual experience; participation in exciting undertakings or enterprises; a bold undertaking; an action of uncertain outcome.’
 
Whether it means taking an exotic trip, learning a new language, becoming a yogi or going on your first climbing expedition, the intention of adventure is to create a deeper connection with your inner-self—one that hungers for excitement, thirsts for exploration and feeds off of adrenaline.
  
Happy Adventure!
