<b>Grillmarkadurinn- The Grill Market / 101 Reykjavík, Iceland.</b>

If you’re after a fancypants place, this is it. It’s not pretentious in the slightest though; but as Icelandics are generally quite humble and conservative, it’s a world away from the quaint pubs and scruffy cafes outside. This is where all of Reykjavík’s social set seem to eat (at least on the evening we were there, anyway). There’s charcoal-grilled steak of Icelandic horse (5,490 kronur) and a sampler of three mini “burgers” featuring lobster, puffin and whale. The restaurant can be hard to find from the street (even with a GPS) but look for the big red building tucked away on Lækjargata.
