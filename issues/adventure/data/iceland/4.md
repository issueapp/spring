For cold weather – jackets and coats must extend past the hip. Nothing cropped as it’s just not warm enough and really does no favours to your layering efforts. Cold-weather clothes can be really bulky and heavy in a suitcase. To refresh your look each day you’re on holiday whilst still keeping warm, just pack a couple of coats or jackets in different prints and styles (and then wear the same thermals or knits underneath) rather than packing a multitude of different tops, sweaters and cardigans which would collectively take up even more space.
