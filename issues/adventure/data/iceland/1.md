<em>Greater Iceland</em>

<b>Gullfoss</b> - often coined the most amazing waterfall in Iceland. Basically, it’s three waterfalls falling into one – so special and unique. Make sure you have lunch at the nearby cafe, Gullfoss Kaffi - more details in the Eat section below.

<b>Geysir</b> - (below) One of the most incredible, jaw-dropping, heart-stopping things I have ever seen in my life and in the world. The Great Geysir, as it is often known, erupts up to 70 metres of boiling water into the air at a 10-15 minute interval.

<em>Reykjavik</em>

<b>Harpa Concert Hall</b> - this is so, so, so, beautiful. It’s a dazzling geometric structure with a honeycomb-like facade that sits on the Waterfront and built (after much controversy) in May 2011. Home to Iceland’s symphony orchestra and opera – I wish we could have seen Sigur Rós perform here!
