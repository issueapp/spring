We booked an airbnb apartment in Reykjavik. There are some good hotels around but because the Icelandics are very house-proud, there are plenty of modern, clean and well-furnished apartments available on airbnb at such cheap rates (compared to the rest of Europe). I think we paid $120 per night for 4 people and that included heating, a fully-equipped kitchen, a nice big bathroom, free (fast!) wifi and a place to park our car (for free).
