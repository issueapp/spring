I met Peter Jamus a little over a year ago in Minneapolis. We crossed paths several times in the fashion circles we both were apart of. I admired and still admire his photographic work; he always evokes such intense emotion in his images and it’s equally perplexing, moving and captivating. I knew I wanted to know him, work with him and share his perspective with others.

We met at the infamous First Avenue venue (where Purple Rain was filmed). One of his goal is a very popular Flickr photography trend of taking a new image every day for the whole year. Peter made about two months in last year. Luckily, it’s a brand new year, and Peter has brand new adventures planned.
