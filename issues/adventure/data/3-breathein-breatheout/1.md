###A New Way to Recharge

I am becoming increasingly more intrigued with the ever-so-popular destination yoga-retreat trend. I happen to be an avid yogi (Iâ€™ve practiced for over eleven years), I wear pretty much only lululemon on the mat and I love traveling to escape the rat race. What could be better for the soul than a luscious trip to somewhere warm, where relaxation is the only thing on the agenda? And what better time to retreat than the present? Especially since, presently, we happen to be the middle of winter. Sounds great, right?
 
I am not the only one who thinks this is a phenomenal idea. There is increasing global fascination with the restorative powers and the recuperative health benefits of yoga that has ultimately created a growing economic development in the Asian, Carribean, Central and South American tourist markets. Not only are these exotic destinations amazing places to travel in general, it is also the new spot for tranquility seekers.
