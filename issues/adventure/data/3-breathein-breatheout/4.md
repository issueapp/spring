##Relaxtion is Luxury

###Destination 1
<b><big>Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat in the Bahamas</big></b>

<img src="../assets/3-breathein-breatheout/bahamas.jpg" alt="">
 
This gorgeous place is located on five acres of gorgeous beach in Paradise Island, Bahamas. Itâ€™s been a place of practice for yogis for more than 40 years. It's a rustic, (read crunchy) place for sure, but it's also insanely affordable. The package price of $89 a night affords you your own little cabin, two vegetarian meals, two yoga classes per day, and morning and evening meditation instruction. For additional fees you can treat yourself to  ayurvedic spa treatments, detoxification and cooking classes. Or the really ambitious, this retreat even offers extended juice fasts.
