Winter wonderment is inspired by outdoor curiosity, a venture into the mountains and a sense of wonderment and playfulness. Fashion around Adventure will be looks that are designed with the outdoors in mind-- lots of layers and natural earth tones. Fluffy outerwear, chunky knits, (hiking) boots, furs and plaids, large scarves and skinny corduroy make up the basics for what one must wear on these outdoor adventures, especially on chilly ones. 

In the depths of the snow mounds, fur and feather down, there lies several opportunities to create adventure-- where discovering new winter activities and winter fashion are magical explorations. A trip to the cabin with the chance of getting snowed in, snow shoeing and then cozying up near a fireplace or even playing with the requisite layering (necessitated by the cold weather) by 
pairing a couple different winter fabrics together.

Anticipate those moments of crisp cold air and beautiful white landscapes, the smell of pine and sandalwood with a new, more daring perspective.
