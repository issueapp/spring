##Northern Lights by Petite Grand

<img src="../assets/5-incu/black.jpg" alt="">

A visit to northern Europe to see the Aurora borealis tops many a bucket list. 
This season you only need a glimpse of one of our favourite homegrown 
jewellery labels to see the sparks.

Petite Grand’s new AW14 collection, “Northern Lights”, draws inspiration from the collision of electrically charged particles from the sun that are only visible near the earth's North Pole. Like the phenomenon that takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, designer Tanja Kovacevic showcases an array of natural forms and colours - eerie pale pink silk cords, geometric charms crafted from sterling silver and delicate 90s-style 14kt gold plated chains. Magnetic and mysterious, each piece makes a statement out of simplicity.

Petite Grand is available at Incu's Paddington and QV Women's stores, and will be coming to their Sydney City Women's store later in the season.
