##Letter from the Editor

There is something exciting about the thought of embarking on uncharted expeditions-- whether literal or figurative. Regardless of which, I am always excited for major changes in the way I experience things and how I will ultimately learn and grow from them.
 
Our particular uncharted expedition comes with a new way of publishing editorial content. Everything we do moving forward in 2013 is going to be an adventure. In being our very first issue, we created the Adventure Issue with a specific thought in mind. I hope you are inspired.
 
Expect our first issue to come from a place of curiosity. A brand new year idea begs the question, ‘How is this going to be better than last?’ We have an answer: Get Adventurous.  Whatever that means for you. The literal definition of adventure is ‘an exciting or very unusual experience; participation in exciting undertakings or enterprises; a bold undertaking; an action of uncertain outcome.’ Think about, but for not too long. 
 
Whether it means taking an exotic trip, learning a new language, becoming a yogi or going on your first climbing expedition, the intention of adventure is to create a deeper connection with your inner-self—one that hungers for excitement, thirsts for exploration and feeds off of adrenaline. There is nothing more exhilarating than pushing yourself through boundaries and facing the unknown with both courage and bravery.  I believe that fearlessness and adventure are best friends and this Issue is meant to inspire both.
 
What’s going to be your adventure? What are going to be the things you do this year that gets you off the couch and into new, unexplored territory? We encourage you to think about it. And act.
 
Happy Adventure,
Nkechi Njaka, Fashion Editor and Content Curator
