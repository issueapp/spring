If you're seeking advice on travel, taking on the wise words of English broadcaster and naturalist, David Attenborough, is a great place to start.
"It seems to me that the natural world is the greatest source of excitement; the greatest source of visual beauty; the greatest source of intellectual interest. It is the greatest source of so much in life that makes life worth living."

So whether it means you embark on a hiking venture up snowed down mountains, go cliff diving in the summer or plan a camping trip with  only the bare utilities of a roof top to hoist above your head, food to sustain and a mere compass to guide you through your walks- getting lost in adventure will never be more rewarding. In essence, travel far enough, that you meet yourself.

We have presented you four breathtaking visuals to induce your senses, one from each season.
