‘I want art to find me. I don’t think I am there yet.’

I met Peter Jamus a little over a year ago in Minneapolis. We crossed paths several times in the fashion circles we both were apart of. I admired and still admire his photographic work; he always evokes such intense emotion in his images and it’s equally perplexing, moving and captivating. I knew I wanted to know him, work with him and share his perspective with others.
 
We met at the infamous First Avenue venue (where Purple Rain was filmed) and talked about his goals for the year. One of which included a very popular Flickr photography trend of taking a new image every day for the whole year. Peter made about two months in last year. Luckily, it’s a brand new year, and Peter has brand new adventures planned.

So who is Peter Jamus and what is he doing differently than last year? ‘I’m finding more purpose and meaning in my work; I had started to loose that working with clients,’ Peter explained when asked what he was focusing on in the next year. 

‘This year I want to focus on personal expression. Closing off the space between the art and the audience.’ EXTROPLOLATE.

For him, that also means owning a body of work that fully summarizes him and his point of view.
