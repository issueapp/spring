The holidays often take a toll on our minds, hearts and bodies and probably the best thing that we can do to replenish ourselves when we are feeling drained is to step away from the madness and ‘get way’ somehow.  Escaping from the grind is not just about just booking a 90-minute massage, driving up the coast or going for a long run. Don’t get me wrong-- those things are all fantastic, but I’m talking about making room for exploration….on a week-long excursion to paradise.
