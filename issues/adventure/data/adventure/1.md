        title: "WINTER"
        caption: Not all of us are fortunate enough to experience a landscape of snowed-down mountains or intricate snowflakes falling from the sky. It may take a bit more time for transport planning or even a little bit more than just dipping into the savings account. but it will definitely be worth the quest! Bomb down snowy mountains with your snowboard and indulge in a half an hour run, accompanied by a freshly made cup of hot cocoa. For an idyllic winter escape, set out on a wilderness trek to the woods and pitch a tent in the howling winds while overlooking picture-perfect views. Collect firewood on your way - because nothing says ‘nature-lover’ than a nifty bonfire, made by yours truly. Thermals are a must.

        title: "Summer"
        caption: Whether you’re exploring secluded waterfalls or taking a dunk in mirrored lakes, summertime is the perfect chance to feel like you’re on a exotic getaway without having to leave the country’s borders. For the daring, plan a group expedition to the nearest falls and cliff dive into pristine waters. Alternatively, for those who prefer more secluded waters, hit the road up the coast- collect sand from your travels, seashells from the beach and build up a beautiful sun-kissed glow.

        title: "Autumn"
        caption: This season, not only are we blessed with moderate heat but with visuals of vibrant colours to appeal and tickle one’s olfactory senses. Set up camp in the woods and bushwalk through lush greenery whilst listening to the rhythmic chirping of the inhabitants who have found home in the rainforest. Wander the heathlands full of wildflowers, while collecting memories along the way. This is the perfect way to embrace your surroundings- wind down, close your eyes and breathe in the fresh sandalwood around you.

        title: "Spring"
        caption: "Enjoy warm, sunny days and cool, crisp nights.
              View the splendor of Philmont fall colors.
              Gaze at wildlife preparing for winter.
              Photograph the panorama of peaks.
              Fish for trout in sparkling streams."
