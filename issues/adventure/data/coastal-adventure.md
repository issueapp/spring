The Grand Pacific Drive evokes a sense of wonder seldom felt elsewhere. Located on the southern coast of New South Wales, the signage allows for an experience that enhances the regions significance. To be at this coast, is to be at an awakening. Hike across the cliff face, listen to the waves crash against the rocks and look across the horizon. Hood pulled up, you blend into the rocky backdrop, but then the weather shifts and the atmosphere draws you into reflection. No one is around and nobody knows youâ€™re here, so what will you do next?
