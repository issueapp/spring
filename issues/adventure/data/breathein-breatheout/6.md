The place is for the off-the-beaten-path type of yogi. And for the adrenaline junky. Have you ever considered practicing yoga on top of an (inactive) volcano? This adventure company offers luxurious (an intmate groups of 20 or less) sailing trips that include spa treatments and gourmet meals. Along with all that, guests can also enjoy a mix of yoga, mountain biking, snorkeling, hiking, visits to remote villages, and visits to pristine and private beaches. The package is pricey ($3,193 for 5 nights, all inclusive), but almost certainly worth saving your pennies for.
