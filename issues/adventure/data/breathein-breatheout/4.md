As our day to day lives become increasingly more chaotic many of us are turning to the practice of yoga and meditation as an elixir to keep both body and mind functioning well.

<p class="subtitle">Bakasana (Crow Pose)</p>

Bakasana is a perfect pose to tone the abdominals while strengthening the shoulders and arms, this position is particularly good for women who would like to build upper body strength. Arm balances cultivate self-confidence whilst keeping you real, every time you fall out is an opportunity to learn and laugh.

<p class="subtitle">Urdhva Mukha Svanasana (Upward Facing Dog)</p>

Upward facing dog simultaneously lengthens the entire front of the body while strengthening the back body and forms an essential part of sun salutations. Practiced on an inhalation Urdhva Mukha Svanasana breathes life into Anahata the heart chakra which governs the relationship between our upper and lower body.

<p class="subtitle">Eka Pada Raja Kapotasana (One-Legged King Pigeon)</p> 

There is nothing like Eka Pada Raja Kapotasana to make your hip flexors sing. It might not be a pretty tune at first but when incorporated into your regular yoga practice your hips will be singing like Beyonc√© soon enough!  This particular version is also great to open the chest and shoulders, the perfect antidote to our often sedentary modern lifestyle.
