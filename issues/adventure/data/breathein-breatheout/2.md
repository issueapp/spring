This place is located on five acres of gorgeous beach in Paradise Island, Bahamas. Itâ€™s been a place of practice for yogis for more than 40 years. It's a rustic, (read crunchy) place for sure, but it's also insanely affordable. The package price of $89 a night affords you your own little cabin, two vegetarian meals, two yoga classes per day, and morning and evening meditation instruction. For additional fees you can treat yourself to  ayurvedic spa treatments, detoxification and cooking classes. Or the really ambitious, this retreat even offers extended juice fasts.

Blue Spirit is a retreat center bordering a nature reserve on the northwest coast of Costa Rica. A saltwater infinity swimming pool is the first thing you see as you approach the center, a sight that sets the tone for an experience of the infinite outdoors. Paths lined with tree-canopies lead yogis to the beach for sunset yoga practice. The menu is mostly vegetarian with the option to feast on fresh-caught fish. Accommodations are solar powered and made with local concrete and sustainably.

<p class="subtitle">Fiji Islands</p>

The place is for the off-the-beaten-path type of yogi. And for the adrenaline junky. Have you ever considered practicing yoga on top of an (inactive) volcano? This adventure company offers luxurious (an intmate groups of 20 or less) sailing trips that include spa treatments and gourmet meals. Along with all that, guests can also enjoy a mix of yoga, mountain biking, snorkeling, hiking, visits to remote villages, and visits to pristine and private beaches. The package is pricey ($3,193 for 5 nights, all inclusive), but almost certainly worth saving your pennies for.
