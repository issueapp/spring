Very few people find winter their favorite season, or more specifically, June their favorite month. Traveling and the scrupulous process of choosing the right look appropriate for the season can be exhausting and sometimes the reason for not leaving the house. Or worse: it can be the reason for leaving the house feeling uncomfortable, not prepared for the cold or not stylish enough.

In the depths of the snow mounds, fur and feather down, there lies several opportunities to create adventure-- where discovering new winter activities and winter fashion are magical explorations. A trip to the cabin with the chance of getting snowed in, snow shoeing and then cozying up near a fireplace or even playing with the requisite layering (necessitated by the cold weather) by 
pairing a couple different winter fabrics together.

Anticipate those moments of crisp cold air and beautiful white landscapes, the smell of pine and sandalwood with a new, more adventurous perspective.

Happy Adventure.
