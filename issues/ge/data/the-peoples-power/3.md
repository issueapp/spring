Consumers could sign up to a reduced-cost energy scheme by ceding control of their air conditioners to their power company. Whether you think that’s cool may depend on whether you’re one of the millions of Australians who don’t have an air conditioner, but who are currently subsidising the cost of a grid built to cope with people who crank the air-con up to the max in summer.

As grid-management software gathers data to help regulate electricity flows and manage outages, it can also analyse that data in different ways. For example, x-number of power lines are cut by falling branches of trees of particular species every time there’s a wind of x-kilometres an hour or more. Many other data elements can be taken into account, until a data-management system is capable of directing crews to trim foliage, neither too much, nor too little for each species of tree, before those branches become a problem. It’s called “predictive maintenance”, says McKenzie.

“There are a lot of technology choices for industry stakeholders to make,” he says. “Without these sorts of technologies, you’d have to keep building the grid and managing the peak. Optimising the network and optimising the investment we make is the key to effectively powering growth in cities.”

To return briefly to batteries: Carter says the cost and size of viable batteries is also one of the factors stalling uptake of electric cars. Strategic placement of car-battery charging stations could be one way of managing electricity load and balancing the books – by bringing demand and payment for electricity a little closer to covering the cost of infrastructure.

“Electric vehicles are a big one here,” Carter explained in the Shock to the System seminar. "They’re a game changer fundamentally… Electric vehicles dramatically increase power consumption, but if they don’t come in for 10 years we’ve still got a big problem to solve.”

Optimising the use of the grid may hold the fort until the electric-car cavalry arrives, or perhaps technology will take society galloping energetically in another, as yet unforeseen, direction.
