Electricity is at the centre of modern life; its reliability is as essential to getting dinner on the table as it is to keeping the economy bubbling. And on all sides of increasingly automated lives, optimisation has become synonymous with power.

On the user side, huge technological advances are now everyday: your battery-powered charged-up phone is your sound system, is your camera and your organiser. Your souped-up laptop is your worldwide research library, your portable office, your PO Box. Household appliances do better jobs on less juice. Offices are smarter – turning the lights off when nobody’s there.

On the supply side, optimisation over the years has been minimal. Coal releases energy, which volts up via a transformer, which buzzes the electricity through transmission lines, and another transformer calms the voltage again to send it wriggling along distribution lines to the consumer. The coal, poles and wires have done their job.
