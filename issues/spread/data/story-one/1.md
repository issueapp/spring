### What makes family food culture so important?

The foods you choose for your family as well as how you source them, prepare them and enjoy them together form the basis of your food culture.  We've prepared some tips below to help you start building a healthy food culture for your family.

### What's on your shopping list?

If you were to open your family's fridge what would you see?  How far has the food that sits in it travelled to get to you?  Is it full of fresh, local produce or imported fruits and veg?

Creating a healthy food culture starts long before you sit down to a meal.  Here are a few tips to help get your started:

-	Try sitting down as a family and talk about your food choices focusing on what is in season and can be sourced locally.
-	When possible, visit a local farmerâ€™s market.

Markets provide the opportunity not only source fresh local produce, but in many cases to also meet the growers and farmers who are producing your food.  It's a great opportunity to teach kids where their food comes from.

### Make Cooking a Family Affair

Preparing your food together as a family is another great way to build your family food culture.  The aromas and rituals associated with cooking can build beautiful memories and help you to create family traditions that can be passed down from generation to generation.

Think about food traditions that you can pass down, like a secret family recipe or a dish that celebrates your family's history and heritage. Also consider new traditions that you can create together, like cooking together as a family this Father's Day.


### Making Time to Chew the Fat

Modern life can be hectic. Busy schedules and demanding work commitments can make it difficult to find the time sit down together and break bread. However, recent research has shown that families who eat together at least 5 times a week are happier and healthier. Here are our top tips for making the most of mealtime with your family:

- <b>Keep it simple</b>. Family meals needn't be elaborate.  Keep the focus on fresh, nourishing food that is easy to prepare.

-	<b>Turn off the technology</b>. Meal times are an opportunity for you to tune in and connect with each other.  Make sure that you aren't distracted with television, cells phones, tablets or laptops.

-	<b>Get talking</b>. Have every family member share news of their day, be an active listener and use this time to make plans together as a family.
