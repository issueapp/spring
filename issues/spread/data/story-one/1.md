    <p>Supervise kids cooking at all times and consider safety when delegating 
    tasks. Have kids do jobs such stirring, rolling and decorating and keep 
    sharp knives and heat sources out of easy reach. Always supervise the 
    use of electrical appliances.</p>

    <h3 id="dont_rush">Don’t rush</h3>

    <p>Cooking with your kids is more about the experience itself rather than 
    the end product. So take your time, be patient with them and use this 
    as an opportunity to connect each other.</p>

    <h3 id="dont_expect_perfection">Don’t Expect Perfection</h3>

    <p>So what if your cake is lopsided or your icing is more blood red than 
    pale pink. Praise kids for their efforts and use mistakes as learning 
    opportunities rather than setbacks.</p>
