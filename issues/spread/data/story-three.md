Treat Dad to one of his all-time favourite meals, burgers on the BBQ!  Making a great burger is easier than you think.  It’s all about using the freshest ingredients.  Our Father’s Day burger recipe calls for grass fed beef, beautiful produce, fresh brioche buns, and to top it all off, try some of Zoosh’s Hey Ho Free Range Egg Garlic Aioli.  

For those with a sweet tooth, there’s our delicious Philadelphia Creamy Orange Cheesecake for dessert.  No-one will ever guess that it took only 30 minutes to prepare.  And since the family can gather round the BBQ while burgers are being turned, it means more time together and less time slaving in the kitchen.

### RECIPES

Ultimate Burger Recipe- serves 8

Ingredients
800g grass fed ground beef (buy the best beef you can afford, you won’t regret it)
2 cloves garlic, chopped finely
1 small handful of parsley, chopped finely
Good pinch of salt and pepper 
1 cup breadcrumbs
4 tablespoons tomato sauce 
1 free range egg
1 cups seeded and chopped jalapeno peppers (canned are okay)
250 grams of Philidephia Cream Cheese, softened
8 brioche buns (buy these fresh the morning of your BBQ)
Sliced, fresh tomatoes, onions and iceberg lettuce to serve
Zoosh’s Hey Ho Free Range Egg Garlic Aioli




### Make it

In a medium bowl, stir together jalapenos and cream cheese 
Place your beef in a large mixing bowl, this will bring it closer to room temperature and make it easier to work with. 
Chop up your garlic and parsley finely, and add to the mixing bowl. 
Add your breadcrumbs, tomato sauce, and egg to the mix. 
This is the point where you get to get your hands dirty and mix your beef patties by hand. Make sure the mix is well combined before forming into burger patties. 
Divide your meat mixture into 16 portions and pat out each to ¼ inch thick.
Place a heaping spoon of the cream cheese mixture onto the center of 8 of the patties. Top with the remaining patties, pressing the edges together to seal.
You can now leave the burgers covered in the refrigerator while you prepare all your sides. 
Once you are ready to cook, you’ll want to fire up your BBQ grill or frying pan to a high heat. 
Cook the burgers around 3 to 5 minutes each side and then rest them approx. 3-5 minutes after cooking to ensure that they are super juicy.
This provides a good opportunity to halve your brioche buns and warm them through on the grill.
Serve burgers with Zoosh’s Hey Ho Garlic Aioli, fresh tomatoes, onions and icebergs and any other toppings your heart desires.


Philadelphia Creamy Orange Cheesecake- serves 8
Ingredients
Grated rind of 2 oranges + orange segments (reserve for garnish)
1 1/2 tablespoons gelatine dissolved in
1 cup chocolate biscuit crumbs
1/2 cup cold water
1/2 cup orange juice
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup butter, melted
150ml can evaporated milk, chilled and whipped
500g block Philadelphia Cream Cheese, softened



### Make It

Combine biscuit crumbs and butter. Press into the base of a 22cm spring form pan; chill.
Stir the gelatine into the water. Heat in a saucepan (or in microwave on HIGH for 20 seconds) until dissolved.
Beat the Philadelphia Cream Cheese until soft, stir in all remaining ingredients, including gelatine mixture. 
Pour into crumb crust and chill until firm.
Decorate with orange segments and serve.


Style It
BBQ’s are not meant to be formal so leave the fancy crockery in the cupboard and use your everyday plates.
Nothing goes better with burgers than ice-cold beer, so fill a tub with ice and fill with beers cold from the fridge at least 30 minutes before your BBQ begins.
Make sure you put out serviettes, these are going to be juicy burgers!
If you don’t have an outdoor setting, move your dining table to the back garden and cover it in a simple rustic cloth, like hessian.
If you don’t have a back garden taken advantage of the many green spaces in your city and move this party to a park with BBQ cooking facilities and picnic benches.
Put out condiments and burger toppings in bowls at the table so that everyone can build their own perfect burger – have a competition to sees whose is best!  
Set-up dessert indoors on the kitchen bench so that people can serve themselves when ready and you can relax.
