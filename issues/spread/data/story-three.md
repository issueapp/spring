Treat Dad to one of his all-time favourite meals, burgers on the BBQ!  Making a great burger is easier than you think.  It’s all about using the freshest ingredients like high quality beef and the freshest produce and bakery bun.  Our Father’s Day burger recipe also includes a molten jalapeno cheese center that delivers a deliciously creamy flavor hit.

For those with a sweet tooth, there’s our Picnic and Caramel Cheesecake Slice.  No-one will ever guess that it took only 40 minutes to prepare.  And since the family can gather round the BBQ while burgers are being turned, it means more time together and less time slaving in the kitchen.
