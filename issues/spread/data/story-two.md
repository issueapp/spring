A casual morning brunch is one of the easiest and most flexible ways 
to entertain. Our menu keeps things simple with a back-to-basics 
cupcake recipe, courtesy of our friends from Smudge, delicious Philly 
cream cheese icing and specialty roast coffee (or hot chocolate for the 
kids) all served buffet style, allowing you to focus your attention on 
your guests and on the guest of honour himself, Dad.

Our cupcake recipe is a perfect one to do with the kids (and even Dad) 
and it's a great way to share the workload and bond as a family before 
you begin the celebrations. See our handy tips on

### MENU

Smudge’s 1234 Cupcake with Philly Cream Cheese Icing

### RECIPES

Smudge 1234 Cupcakes with Philly Cream Cheese Icing

### Ingredients

200 grams butter, room temperature
1 cup sugar
2.5 cups self-raising flour
3 eggs
1/2 cup milk
250g Philly Cream Cheese, softened
1⁄4 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla essence
4 cups icing sugar, sifted

### Method

Preheat the oven to 180°C. Place patty pans on a baking tray or inside 
a muffin tray. Gradually cream the sugar into the butter until the 
mixture is light and fluffy and the butter has become almost white 
in colour. In a separate bowl beat the eggs for a few minutes with a 
whisk until they are well blended, then incorporate them into your 
mixture. Sift in the self-raising flour and add the milk and mix until 
well combined. 

Pour or spoon your batter into the prepared patty pans and bake in 
the oven for 15-20 minutes for large cupcakes and 10-12 minutes for 
mini cupckaes. You will know your cupcakes are ready when they 
spring back when you touch them lightly with your fingertip. 

While cupcakes are baking, make the icing:

1.	BEAT cream cheese, butter and vanilla in large bowl with mixer until well blended.
2.	ADD sugar gradually, beating until well blended after each addition.
3.	TRY one or all  of the variations below for your cupcake bar:

Coconut Philly Cream Cheese Icing
Prepare as directed. Stir in ½ cup toasted coconut.

Chocolate Philly Cream Cheese Icing
Prepare as directed. Beat in ½ cup cocoa powder.

Orange Philly Cream Cheese Icing
Prepare as directed. Beat in 2 tablespoons of orange juice and 1 teaspoon of orange zest.

Technicolor Philly Cream Cheese Icing
Does your Dad have a favourite colour? Prepare as directed and beat in 2-3 drops of food colouring of your choice to get the desired shade.

### Style It


- Choose a large surface that can be easily accessed by your guests, such as a dining room table, bench or buffet.

- If you have a barista style coffee machine like the Little Guy (link to Little Guy method), set it up on the buffet so that guests can make their own coffee to order or  set-up thermos flasks of French Press (link to French Press method) coffee which you can replenish as needed.

- Line up coffee cups, stir spoons and saucers – don’t feel the need to be too formal, mismatched crockery can look lovely and add colour to the table. 

- Include different kinds of sweeteners such as raw sugar, white sugar and honey as well as milk and cream if you are serving french press coffee, and cinnamon and chocolate powder if serving cappuccino style coffees.

- If the mood strikes, why not include a few bottles of specialty liquor that guests can add to their coffee such as Baileys, Tia Maria and Cointreau.  After all, it is a celebration, just make sure that your guests enjoy the spirits responsibly.   

- Pre-frost cupcakes with a selection of icings from our Philly Cream Cheese Icing recipe and display them on two tier cake trays or in rows. 

- Fill bowls with cupcakes toppings such as:
- Chocolate sprinkles
- Coconut flakes
- Berries
- Toasted almond flakes
- Jelly beans
- Hundreds and Thousands
