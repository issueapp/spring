A casual morning brunch is one of the easiest and most flexible ways 
to entertain. Our menu keeps things simple with a back-to-basics 
cupcake recipe, courtesy of our friends from Smudge, delicious Philly 
cream cheese icing and specialty roast coffee (or hot chocolate for the 
kids) all served buffet style, allowing you to focus your attention on 
your guests and on the guest of honour himself, Dad.
