Food nourishes us, comforts us, and can bring us together in a way that nothing else
can. So it’s no surprise that it plays such an important role in family life.

So what is family food culture and why is it so important? 

The act of eating is both personal and cultural. The foods you choose for your 
family as well as how you source them, prepare them and enjoy them together form 
the basis of your food culture. We’ve prepared some tips below to help you start 
building a healthy food culture for your family. 

### What’s on your shopping list?

If you were to open your family’s fridge what would you see? How far has the food 
that sits in it travelled to get to you? Is it full of fresh, local produce or imported 
fruits and veg? Do you know how your food was grown? Are most of the items in 
their natural state or have they been heavily processed and packaged? 

Creating a healthy food culture starts long before you sit down to a meal. When 
building your weekly shopping list try the following: 

- Sit down as a family and talk about your food choices focusing on what is in season and can be sourced locally. 
- Consider hitting up a farmer’s market rather than visiting your local supermarket. Markets provide the opportunity not only source fresh local produce, but in many cases to also meet the growers and farmers who are producing your food. It’s a great opportunity to teach kids where their food comes from.

### Make Cooking a Family Affair

Preparing your food together as a family is another great way to build your family 
food culture. The aromas and rituals associated with cooking can build beautiful 
memories and help you to create family traditions that can be passed down from 
generation to generation. 

Think about food traditions that you can pass down, like a secret family recipe or a 
dish that celebrates your family’s history and heritage. Also consider new traditions 
that you can create together, like cooking together as a family this Father’s Day. Get 
the kids involved, get Dad involved and get cooking! 

### Families that eat together, stay together

Modern life can be hectic. Busy schedules and demanding work commitments 
can make it difficult to find the time sit down together and break bread. However, 
recent research has shown that families who eat together at least 5 times a week are 
happier and healthier. Here are our top tips for making the most of mealtime with 
your family:

- *Keep it simple*. Family meals needn’t be elaborate. Keep the focus on fresh, nourishing food that is easy to prepare. 

- *Turn off the technology*. Meal times are an opportunity for you to tune in and connect with each other. Make sure that you aren’t distracted with television, cells phones, tablets or laptops. 

- *Get talking*. Have every family member share news of their day, be an active listener and use this time to make plans together as a family.
