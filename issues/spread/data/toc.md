Welcome to the first edition of Spread. Enjoy our stories that celebrate all things family, especially 
all the men in your life for Father’s Day. Rather than a pair of socks, we have given you the 
ingredients for a wonderful day of food and memories – something every Dad will treasure.

There’s nothing more luxurious than being served breakfast in bed, especially when the menu is 
naughty cup-cakes with creamy, sweet icing, baked at home by yourself and the kids. Accompany 
this with some specialty coffee, and your thoughtful gesture will be remembered forever. Instead of 
a shop-bought card, how about taking some photos of the fun you and the kids had with the flour, 
eggs and cream cheese? Print these at home and get the kids to write special messages to Dad. You 
could also add the photos to your Facebook page, showing everyone the fun you had preparing for 
Dad’s special day.

For lunch, there is nothing more boyish than a burger – and again the home-made variety will be 
prized. We have provided the tips and recipes to make all this happen – and Dad can join in the fun 
by manning the barbecue to discover how magical it is when the family joins forces and spends fun 
time together. 

These are the experiences that start family traditions – and it is the strength of these threads that 
build strong relationships. It is also what memories are made from. And after all, it’s the memories in 
life that, woven together, make your story (or life) special.

As guest editor, I have enjoyed pulling these family stories together on this new digital platform. I 
have also had fun playing with the interactive elements to produce a more personal experience for 
you. Have fun until next month – and enjoy these special moments with your family.
