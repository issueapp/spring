### RECIPES

Ultimate Burger Recipe - serves 8

Ingredients

- 800g high quality beef mince (for a special treat look for grass-fed beef)
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped finely
- 1 small handful of parsley, chopped finely
- Good pinch of salt and pepper 
- 1 cup breadcrumbs
- 4 tablespoons tomato sauce 
- 1 free range egg
- 1 cups seeded and chopped jalapeno peppers (canned are okay)
- 250 grams of Philadelphia Original Block Cream Cheese, softened
- 8 burger buns (brioche buns are a yummy splurge)
- Sliced, fresh tomatoes, onions and iceberg lettuce to serve 
- Zoosh’s Hey Ho Free Range Egg Garlic Aioli



### Make it

1.	In a medium bowl, stir together jalapenos and cream cheese 
2.	Place your beef in a large mixing bowl, this will bring it closer to room temperature and make it easier to work with. 
3.	Chop up your garlic and parsley finely, and add to the mixing bowl. 
4.	Add your breadcrumbs, tomato sauce, and egg to the mix. 
5.	This is the point where you get to get your hands dirty and mix your beef patties by hand. Make sure the mix is well combined before forming into burger patties. 
6.	Divide your meat mixture into 16 portions and pat out each to ¼ inch thick.
7.	Place a heaping spoon of the cream cheese mixture onto the center of 8 of the patties. Top with the remaining patties, pressing the edges together to seal.
8.	You can now leave the burgers covered in the refrigerator while you prepare all your sides. 
9.	Once you are ready to cook, you’ll want to fire up your BBQ grill or frying pan to a high heat. 
10.	Cook the burgers around 3 to 5 minutes each side and then rest them approx. 3-5 minutes after cooking to ensure that they are super juicy.
11.	This provides a good opportunity to halve your brioche buns and warm them through on the grill.
12.	Serve burgers with Zoosh’s Hey Ho Garlic Aioli, fresh tomatoes, onions and lettuce and any other toppings your heart desires.
