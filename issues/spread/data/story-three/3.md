-	BBQ’s are not meant to be formal so leave the fancy crockery in the cupboard and use your everyday plates.
-	Nothing goes better with burgers than ice-cold beer. Make sure you chill them in ice water at least 30 minutes before your BBQ begins.
-	Make sure you put out serviettes, these are going to be juicy burgers!
-	Put out condiments and burger toppings in bowls at the table so that everyone can build their own perfect burger – have a competition to see whose is best!
-	Set-up dessert indoors on the kitchen bench so that people can serve themselves when ready and you can relax.
