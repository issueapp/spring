BBQ’s are not meant to be formal so leave the fancy crockery in the cupboard and use your everyday plates.

Nothing goes better with burgers than ice-cold beer, so fill a tub with ice and fill with beers cold from the fridge at least 30 minutes before your BBQ begins.

Make sure you put out serviettes, these are going to be juicy burgers!
If you don’t have an outdoor setting, move your dining table to the back garden and cover it in a simple rustic cloth, like hessian.

If you don’t have a back garden taken advantage of the many green spaces in your city and move this party to a park with BBQ cooking facilities and picnic benches.

Put out condiments and burger toppings in bowls at the table so that everyone can build their own perfect burger – have a competition to sees whose is best!  

Set-up dessert indoors on the kitchen bench so that people can serve themselves when ready and you can relax.
