This is one of the easiest ways to start brewing coffee at home. All you will need is fresh coffee, scales, a grinder, plunger and water. The Result is a heavy-bodied coffee with a super simple process.


Grind: Coarsely ground (22g)
Brewing Time: 4½minutes 

YOU WILL NEED:
- Three Cup Glass Plunger (400ml)
- Water (350ml)
-Stirrer
- Fresh Coffee (22g)
- Your Favourite Mug

1. Measure out your coffee (22g) and water (350ml). Grind your coffee a little coarser than you would for a drip grind.

2. Preheat your plunger with hot water then discard it and add your ground coffee.

3. Pour the water you measured out on top of your grounds right up to the top, ensuring even coverage and that everything is saturated. Once you’ve poured in the water wait 30 seconds then knock down the bloom by folding the coffee down with a spoon to make sure everything extracts evenly. 

4. Put the lid on it so the heat doesn’t escape and twiddle your thumbs for 4 minutes. Once 4 minutes is up, push your plunger down and pour into your cup. If you’re not going to drink it all at once, make sure you still pour out all the coffee.  If the water is in contact with the coffee it’s still brewing and can become pretty bitter.
