- Display the iced cupcakes on a flat tray or tiered cake tray

- Fill little bowls with cupcake toppings that guests can add themselves. Here are some ideas:
  1. Chocolate sprinkles

  2. Coconut flakes

  3. Berries  

- Line up coffee cups, stir spoons and saucers – don’t feel the need to be too formal, mismatched serviceware can look lovely and add colour to the table. 

- If the mood strikes, why not include a few bottles of specialty liquor that guests can add to their coffee such as Baileys, Tia Maria and Cointreau.  It is a celebration, just make sure that your guests enjoy the spirits responsibly.
