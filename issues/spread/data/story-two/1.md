Choose a large surface that can be easily accessed by your guests, such as a dining room table, bench or buffet.

If you have a barista style coffee machine like the Little Guy (link to Little Guy method), set it up on the buffet so that guests can make their own coffee to order or  set-up thermos flasks of French Press (link to French Press method) coffee which you can replenish as needed.

Line up coffee cups, stir spoons and saucers – don’t feel the need to be too formal, mismatched crockery can look lovely and add colour to the table. 

Include different kinds of sweeteners such as raw sugar, white sugar and honey as well as milk and cream if you are serving french press coffee, and cinnamon and chocolate powder if serving cappuccino style coffees.

If the mood strikes, why not include a few bottles of specialty liquor that guests can add to their coffee such as Baileys, Tia Maria and Cointreau.  After all, it is a celebration, just make sure that your guests enjoy the spirits responsibly.   

Pre-frost cupcakes with a selection of icings from our Philly Cream Cheese Icing recipe and display them on two tier cake trays or in rows. 

Fill bowls with cupcakes toppings such as:

  - Chocolate sprinkles
  - Coconut flakes
  - Berries
  - Toasted almond flakes
  - Jelly beans
  - Hundreds and Thousands
