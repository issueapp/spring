Our cupcake recipe is a perfect one to do with the kids (and even Dad) and it's a great way to share the workload and bond as a family before you begin the celebrations.  See our handy tips on <a href="story-one/2">cooking with kids</a>.

### Ingredients

- 200 grams butter, room temperature
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 ½  cups self-raising flour
- 3 eggs
- ½  cup milk
- 250g PHILADELPHIA Original Block Cream Cheese, softened
- ¼ cup butter or margarine, softened
- 1 teaspoon vanilla essence
- 4 cups icing sugar, sifted

### Method

Preheat the oven to 180°C. Place patty pans on a baking tray or inside a muffin tray. Gradually cream the sugar into the butter until the mixture is light and fluffy and the butter has become almost white in colour. Beat the eggs in separate bowl and then beat them into the butter/sugar mixture until incorporated. Sift in the self-raising flour and add the milk ¼ cup at a time, stirring to incorporate. 

Spoon your batter into the prepared patty pans and bake in the oven 15-17 minutes for large cupcakes or 10-12 minutes for mini cupcakes. You will know your cupcakes are ready if they spring back when touched lightly with your fingertip. 

While cupcakes are baking, make the frosting:

1.	<b>BEAT</b> cream cheese, butter and vanilla in large bowl with mixer until well blended.
2.	<b>ADD</b> sugar gradually, beating until well blended after each addition.
3.	<b>TRY</b> one or all of the variations below for your cupcake bar:
4.	Stir in ½ cup toasted coconut
5.	Beat in ½ cup cocoa powder
6.	Beat in 2tablespoons of orange juice and 1teaspoon of orange zest
7.	Does your Dad have a favourite colour? Beat 2-3 drops of food colouring into your frosting to get the desired shade
