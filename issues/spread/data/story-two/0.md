Our cupcake recipe is a perfect one to do with the kids (and even Dad) 
and it's a great way to share the workload and bond as a family before 
you begin the celebrations. See our handy tips on 
<a href="story-two/1">cooking with kids.</a>

### Ingredients

- 200 grams butter, room temperature
- 1 cup sugar
- 2.5 cups self-raising flour
- 3 eggs
- 1/2 cup milk
- 250g Philly Cream Cheese, softened
- 1⁄4 cup butter or margarine, softened
- 1 teaspoon vanilla essence
- 4 cups icing sugar, sifted

### Method

Preheat the oven to 180°C. Place patty pans on a baking tray or inside 
a muffin tray. Gradually cream the sugar into the butter until the 
mixture is light and fluffy and the butter has become almost white 
in colour. In a separate bowl beat the eggs for a few minutes with a 
whisk until they are well blended, then incorporate them into your 
mixture. Sift in the self-raising flour and add the milk and mix until 
well combined. 

Pour or spoon your batter into the prepared patty pans and bake in 
the oven for 15-20 minutes for large cupcakes and 10-12 minutes for 
mini cupckaes. You will know your cupcakes are ready when they 
spring back when you touch them lightly with your fingertip. 

While cupcakes are baking, make the icing:

1.	BEAT cream cheese, butter and vanilla in large bowl with mixer until well blended.
2.	ADD sugar gradually, beating until well blended after each addition.
3.	TRY one or all  of the variations below for your cupcake bar:
