It’s 4.30am and the dawn light is creeping quietly across the still waters of Sydney Harbour. But one corner of the city is already in full swing. Amid the morning calm, Sydney’s Fish Markets are a riot of colour, noise and fluro-vested workers examining the day’s catch. In the bustle, Charlie Ianni and his brother-in-law Peter Tzavaras, from Northside Seafood, supplier of Opera Bar, pace through crates of tuna, squid, barramundi and spanner crab, noting down the best seafood in readiness for the auction.

“I’ve been working at the fish markets since the 1990s,” says Tzavaras, “I used to come down here on my school holidays and now I do all the buying. We’re here an hour before the auction starts looking at everything that has come off the local boats and from around Australia.”

Securing the best fish is no easy task. First, there’s the relationship with the fishermen and the skippers, who Ianni and Tzavaras are in constant contact with while they’re out to sea. Then, when the seafood arrives, they are first in to see and grade the produce. They’ll turn a spanner crab over, noting the weight, colour and firmness. Scallops are inspected for a well-sculpted, flat shell and plump and sizeable meat. It’s all part of ensuring that the best of the markets makes its way onto the Raw Bar at Opera Bar.

Then there’s grading a tuna, which seems more like they’re reading the fish’s aura than checking its quality. “From a tiny slit in the tail this big,” says Tzavaras, bringing his thumb and forefinger about a centimetre apart, “we can judge it for clarity, bloodline and … well, I’m not going to give away all my secrets! But from that tiny piece of meat, I can see how good a 100 kilogram tuna is.”

They also pay close attention to where - and as importantly - how the fish are caught. “We support local fishermen and those with wild, line caught fish that are killed instantly. And then we’ll talk to the chefs about what exactly they want.”

The auction starts with a terrace full of buyers sitting in front of a giant board with all the prices flashing. But this is a Dutch Auction, which means the prices start high and work low until someone bids. “The person who buys first also has options on how many boxes they want to buy,” says Ianni, “So if I try to get something cheaper, I might miss out on the whole lot.”

Ianni, who worked on prawn trawlers in the 1980s before coming onshore to liaise with chefs and restaurateurs, says their jobs have changed over the years from merely selling fish to increasingly acting as a sounding board. “The chefs and other buyers ask for our ideas more these days,” says Ianni. “The sort of fish that is on trend, what’s in season, that sort of thing. We’re out there every weekend experiencing dining in places whereas before we didn’t have to do that. We’re seeing a lot more whole and raw fish and a lot less done to the fish. And the Raw Bar at Opera Bar is the best expression of that - the fish is back to being the star of the show!”

  <p>If you’re tucking into a half dozen Pacific oysters, pair them with the NV Foss Marai Prosecco Extra Dry from Valdobbiadene, Italy which is fresh and creamy with just the right amount of crisp acidity.</p>
