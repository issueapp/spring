For 13 years, Matt Moran has seen Opera Bar grow into one of the busiest bars in the country. Now, with another ten years to look forward to, Moran has given what he calls “the best precinct in Australia” a serious makeover. “We wanted to do something different,” he says. "It’s all about giving it that real kick it deserves. It’s a complete refit and it’s exciting times.”

The new Opera Bar is all about moving into dining in the twenty-first century. It’s about bringing local produce from the paddock or the ocean to the plate. It’s about spanner crab, Sydney rock oysters and scampi on shared plates, Blackmore's wagyu bresaola and slow-roasted Moran lamb shoulders. All served up with the most stunning views in the city.

“People nowadays want to know where their food is coming from, who’s growing and producing it,” says Moran, who comes from five generations of farmers and runs his property in the Central Tablelands with his father. “People are also more adventurous now, they’ve got a lot more knowledge and they want to try different things - gone are the days where we just ate devon!”
