Asger Juel Larsen is a designer that marks and merits the adventurous and rule breaking reinvention of modern menswear. The attitude of the aesthetic is ambitious, ambiguous, and charged with statement on both a visual and emotional level. Music, performance, history and propaganda play both a central and collaborative role in the collections. Asger's new breed of tailoring offers unconventional sporty structure for a modern mood and generation.Â 
This is heritage that truly hopes you hellraise.
