Asger’s burst of individuality and expression has become widely embraced on an international level, having recently won the highly acclaimed 2014/15  International Woolmark Prize in the European Regional Menswear sector. Previous winners include Karl Lagerfeld and Yves Saint Laurent.

According to Director of the masculine world of Hermès, Véronique Nichanian, said that the decision was unanimous because Asger’s presentation was very well articulated and his research on fabrics and textures were elaborate and accomplished.

Having deservingly won the menswear contest between 20 promising talents in European design, Asger was given a generous financial contribution but even more thrillingly, the opportunity to represent Europe and compete in the prestigious international final for menswear which will be held in London Collections: Men on January 2015. 

Keep those eyes on a close look-out because for the next six to eight months, Asger will be developing his capsule collection in Merino wool. His exceptional pieces will be showcased in another event, where it will highlight the five finalists which will be selected from across the world for both menswear and womenswear.
