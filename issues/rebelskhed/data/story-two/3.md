Imagine a decadent like wallpaper that has stinging nettles made of iron growing out from it. This print is like a web of deconstructed handcuffs with a playful swirl in its sting. A stained glass church window is also broken into bits of coding, creating a liquidated, winter blue Tetris print.

This survival manual is a testament to the designerâ€™s alternative utopia, nurturing a unique aesthetic of his own. Streetwear is taken out of its comfort zone and given a cold touch, showcasing a warfare against the elements. Getting lost has never made so much sense...and who says camouflage can't stand out?
