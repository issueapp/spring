Take the associations with looking up into space, and bring this elusive and ambiguous frame of mind to gravity. This is a story of survival from the unlikeliest explorers. Rebels who are belittled and befriended by their new surroundings. Boundaries and morals are blurred in the extreme cold conditions, creating an aesthetic that is severe, arctic, and somewhere altogether sci-fi. Getting lost has never made so much sense...and who says camouflage can’t stand out?

Asger’s SS14 collection has a psychotic bliss about it.

Society has become a dystopian dagger to the senses, defining imagination as treason and establishing mindless existence as propaganda for the ‘proper’. In a city that was created by a generic computer game click, those brave few that thought ‘fuck it’ to that bleak bubble, burst it by going out headbanging, chewing some gum, and encouraging a rave in a supermarket car park. They were sent to the mental hospital and forced to watch daytime TV in straight jackets... little did the system realize that these rebels were busy creating a world of their own.
