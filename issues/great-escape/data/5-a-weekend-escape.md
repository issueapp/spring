Blue skies and balmy summer nights, summer in Bali is definitely one to be spent soaking up the sun and being carefree.  If you’re anything like me and prefer a little secluded, clear water and white sand kind of beach, make sure Geger Beach is on your to do list. Pamper yourself to a full body massage as you soak up the sun and quench your thirst with mango mocktails.  For that instant getaway, I like to stay local in Sydney and head down Bondi to pop in their cafes after a early morning walk!  Alternatively, a trip up Palm beach is ideal, only an hour away from Sydney it’s multi-million dollar views and shell adorned beach houses will leave visitors planning a second trip there!
