Ubud is a nice change of pace and scenery from the main strip of Kuta, Legian and Seminyak in Bali. Its refreshing greenery makes days more cool and relaxing when the weather gets hot and humid. For first timers, it’s suggested to visit the Monkey Forest in Ubud. You can buy fruit to feed the monkeys, but be warned, these cheeky little creatures have a tendency to pop out of nowhere or  jump on top of your bag for a quick rummage!

Make a day out of it by also going to the Rice Fields. In true Bali fashion, you can stop over on top of the rice fields, sit under a little hut to try Kopi Luwak and sip on some fresh coconuts.

Next, take a stroll around Ubud markets.  Here you’ll find printed sari’s and scarves, little baskets (weaved, which they use for Balinese offerings and beaded, great for interior decorations) a little bit of clothing, jewellery and beaded accessories and those inevitable ‘I heart Bali’ and ‘Bintang’ stubby holders – which are pretty much everywhere.
