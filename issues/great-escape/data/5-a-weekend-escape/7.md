The Grounds offers a wholesome and rustic menu; equally as perfect for a group lunch as a breakfast for two. To catch a great vibe, head in early on the first weekend of each month when The Grounds Markets are on - catch live music performances, enjoy brunch, own-roasted coffee and a selection of hand-made treats, explore an abundance of fresh produce and wholesome goods, sip on fresh lemonades in the cafe garden and pick up some beautiful blooms on your way out. Whatâ€™s not to love at The Grounds?
