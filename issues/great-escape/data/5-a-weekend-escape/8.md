For an all round great vibe book in for dinner at Nomad, 16 Foster Street Surry Hills

Located in a historic warehouse on the fringe of Surry Hills, Nomad ticks all the right boxes - great food (their charcuterie selection is a must try - cut to order and served on a round rustic wooden board), a great selection and ever evolving wine list, and exceptional service. Nomad is one restaurant not to miss!

For drinks, Opera Bar, Sydney Opera House, Lower Concourse Level has you sorted - your favourite cocktail, wine or beer and the best views of the shimmering Sydney Harbour. They also serve food if you prefer dinner and drinks or get a little nibbly. Our favourite drink for a balmy summer night? The Moscato Mojito cocktail or the ‘Summertime’ cocktail jug for a group.
