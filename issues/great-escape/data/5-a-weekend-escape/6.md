For a great local feel head to Bondi Picnic, 101 Hall Street, Bondi Beach

Friendly owners, locally sourced produce and one tasty menu make Bondi Picnic a favourite among the locals. A great spot to sit in the sun drenched table out the front and people watch over an early breakfast or your morning coffee. Order their avocado on toast - itâ€™s an Aussie favourite with a combination of vegemite, avocado and lemon on multigrain sourdough (poached eggs optional) and their delicious banana smoothie!
