###BRUNCH
Sea Circus / 22 Jalan Kayu Aya [Oberoi Rd], Seminyak Bali. 

If you’ve felt how humd it can get in Bali, granitas and fresh juices are definitely a delicious treat to cool you down. Look no further than Sea Circus located in 22 Jalan Kayu Aya [Oberoi Rd], Seminyak Bali and try the ‘love- me-not’ granita! Breakfast gets full quite quick here, so I suggest you either go early (they open at 8am) or go for brunch (around 10-10:30am).  Hungover from the endless  serve of cocktails the night before? They offer the perfect hangover cure in the form of poached eggs on toast, pink fruit salad, herbal tea/ coffee, coconut water, sliced orage and wheatgrass shot. And for only a few more Rupiahs, they’ll throw in a neck and shoulder massage too! Can it get any better than this?     
     
          
               
               
###DINNER

Potato Head Beach Club / Jalan Petitenget Seminyak, Bali 

Not too miss! Chill out and watch the sunset over drinks here. Or if you get in a little earlier you can eat, drink and hang by the pool. There’s also Eleven Boutique at the bottom of the beach club so if you wanted to squeeze in a little shopping before or after, you could!
