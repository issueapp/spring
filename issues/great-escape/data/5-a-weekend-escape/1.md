From Boutique / Jalan Laksmana, Seminyak Bali     

If you’re a minimalist at heart I’m sure you’ll love this store just as much as I did. ‘From’ in Seminyak stock a fine selection of international eyewear labels like Céline and Karen Walker, PARADIS skincare and homeware and their own line full of minimal basics in a clean and fresh sorbet colour palette. Bliss. Their merchandising is simple yet refreshing so if you’re in Bali and looking for some minimalist luxe pieces to add to your purchases, you should definitely pop in for a visit!
