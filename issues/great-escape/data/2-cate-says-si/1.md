The Si woman is nothing short of ordinary. Her exuberant nature; her  balance of strength and femininity; her elegant sensuality; her insatiable desire to live her life freely. The Si woman has the ability to make her presence known.

So it’s only fitting that Giorgio Armani would select Cate Blanchett as the face of  his new fragrance, Si. Cate symbolises the spirit of what it means to be a modern day woman- her beauty is effortlessly unblemished and yet continues to make her mark in the world as Australia’s own Independent woman. She embodies a sense of courage, the courage to say Sì! (Yes!) to opportunities and embrace it wholeheartedly.

“The Armani woman is simultaneously modern and effortless.” -Cate Blanchett
