My favourite way to spend summer in my hometown, Perth, is to pack all my favourite belongings in a car and head ‘down south’ for a few days. Stealing glimpses of the Indian Ocean whilst we drive along to a nostalgic summer soundtrack always makes for a perfect roadtrip. And once you’re there? Eat, drink, and be merry. Don’t forget to pack some SPF, a floppy hat, and hang a left towards Smiths Beach until the sun goes down. It’s summer love at first sight and last light.
