Breakfast at White Elephant Beach Cafe - order the smoked salmon bagel with capers and cream cheese, and grab a seat under the beach umbrella as the Indian Ocean crashes to shore, only metres away from you. Whatâ€™s not to love?

Dinner at Morries - perfect for a post-beach aperitif and nibbles as the sun sets. Stay for cocktails and delve into the delicious tapas menu!
