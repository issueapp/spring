The itinerary is simple: wander the town's lanes; catch the boat to Porto Venere; take the La via dell'Amore path to the dizzying heights of Riomaggiore; and - last but certainly not least - eat gelato all day, every day. Paint your nails in a sherbet shade of Holiday and throw on a floral dress as you meander your way along the Italian Riviera. Itâ€™s the Way of Love, after all.
