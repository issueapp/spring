###Lunch 
Pizzeria La Smorfia / Vittorio Emanuele, 73, 19016, Monterosso     

Arguably the best pizzeria in Monterosso. The Quattro Formaggi and the Margherita are standouts - and be sure to chase them down with the house wine for a mouthwatering meal that will set you back only 9 euros.

###Dinner
Marina Piccola / Lo Scalo, 16, 19010 Manarola     

Grab a table here and enjoy a glass of the Cinque Terre sciacchetr√† as the sun sets over the Mediterranean Sea.
