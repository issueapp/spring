> The best kind of pieces are the ones that are most versatile, and this Little Black Dress (LBD) is one of those rare kinds. Dress it down with sandals or your classic ballet flats during the day for a look a little casual chic, or pair it with some bold heels for a night out. Look for detail and texture in your next LBD purchase, this one has a simple peplum hem which gives it a playful touch.
