##FIRST BASE

Think of your face like a canvas and yourself as a painter. Just like how a primer is needed to increase paint durability, so too does the face (but with makeup of course). Create the perfect base by first moisturising your face with a hydrating cream (3) then prime with Chanel Sheer Illuminating Base(5). Using a kabuki brush, buff on some mineral foundation(7) or for those who need that little bit of hydration, opt for Kate Sommerville’s CC Cream(1) which also contains SPF50+. The primer hides imperfections by minimising the appearance of pores and redness, while the foundation evens out discolouration to give a silky, radiant finish.

## BRONZING BELLA

It’s amazing what the wonders of bronzer can do. It can reduce the appearance of your most unfavourable features or create the illusion of a slimmer face. Using a contouring brush, lightly apply a layer of Illamasqua bronzing powder(9) “Writhe” (darker colour) in a “3” motion on the side of your face. Start at the top of your forehead near the temples, working your way down to the cheekbone and back out along the jawline. If you feel that your jawline is quite narrow already, you can choose to skip this step.

##CREATE THE CONTOURS

Here’s where you’ll see the most change in the look of your face; adding more depth to your best features while beautifying features that go unnoticed.
Using a small blending brush, apply bronzer (9) from the inner corner of your brow and down the sides of the bridge of the nose to the top rim of your nostrils. You can go that extra mile by lightly applying bronzer to the sides of the nostrils.
Apply more bronzer to the hollows of your cheeks to create the look of high cheek bones.
