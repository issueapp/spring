      brand: Illamasqua bronzer
      description:
        Inspired by the glorious beauty of the Sirens and the enthralling  nature of their appeal, Illamasqua has created this product designed to laud the divine being within us all. This duo-bronzer contains crushed pearl powder for a smooth, even finish that radiates a sumptuous sun-kissed glow. Owing to it’s multi-use abilities, this powder can be swirled together and applied all over the face for luminosity and alternatively, the lighter colour can act as a highlighter while the darker colour as a bronzer. Both shades can double up as eyeshadows. We suggest that fairer skins should opt for ‘glint and writhe’ while medium-dark skin tones would match nicely with ‘glint and burnish.’ With this all-encompassing bronzer, there is no way you’ll be short of celestial beauty.

##MINIM-EYES

Illamasqua bronzer can double up as an eyeshadow but alternatively, you can ditch the eyeshadow and mascara because this season is all about keeping your eye makeup to its minimal, as seen on the runways of Westwood, Chloe, Balenciaga and Giambattista Valli. Emphasise the lash line by using a soft colour eye pencil (brown) and blend along the line with a cue tip for some lash definition. Bold brows are the best accessories to any woman’s face, so try Eyeko’s brow gel (11) to keep hairs at place and visibly enhance brow appearance.

##FAIR FLUSH

This season, the cheeks are lightly flushed as seen on  Vera Wang. Lightly brush on Illamasqua bronzer “Glint”, a soft luminous peach colour to create a light radiant flush, the type after a brisk morning walk.

##HAIL THE HIGHLIGHTS

Complete the look with illuminators to create a natural dewy finish. Lightly dab Burberry’s Luminous Concealer (8) on the bridge of the nose, inner corner of the eyes and the bow of the mouth and blend in. Dot on the luminous concealer in a “C” shape, starting from the the brow bone to the top of the cheeks then blend up and down.

Now seal in all that goodness by spritzing the face with M.A.C. Fix+(10) to prolong your makeup and keep you feeling cool and fresh in the summer heat!
