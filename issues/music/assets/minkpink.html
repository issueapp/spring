Working on the campaign has been a blast, but what’s even better is that now I get to share it with all of you! </span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-5">Right off the bat I’ve felt a connection to </span><span class="CharOverride-7">minkpink</span><span class="CharOverride-5">. I love the way they constantly push the boundaries when it comes to all things creative - i<a id="Anchor-4"></a>t’s something I am always striving to do in my own career, so to be able to work with a brand with that same outlook is pretty exciting. </span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-5">This time round, they’ve come up with the brain-achingly awesome idea of presenting the entire campaign in this magazine, jampacked with heaps of content including the official campaign shoot and tons of exclusive behind-the-scenes footage, meaning you get to feast your eyes on the latest rad </span><span class="CharOverride-7">minkpink </span><span class="CharOverride-5">threads all in one go!

With a killer look and a voice that is guaranteed to melt evenx the iciest of hearts, </span><span class="CharOverride-7">minkpink</span><span class="CharOverride-5"> are beyond stoked to have tapped this one up!</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-5">An alternative Disney princess in her very own </span><span class="CharOverride-9">modern day fairy tale</span><span class="CharOverride-5">, Christina shot to fame in 2010 when <br />her song ‘Jar of Hearts’ (just a little ditty she penned whilst sitting in her bedroom in her PJs one day) became a global <br /></span><span class="CharOverride-9">smash hit</span><span class="CharOverride-5"> after it was picked up by choreographer Stacey Tookey and played on US TV show ‘So You Think You Can Dance’. Since then, it’s been a head spinningly </span><span class="CharOverride-9">crazy ride</span><span class="CharOverride-5"> for uber-talented singer-songwriter Christina…and it <br />shows no signs of slowing!</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-7">minkpink</span><span class="CharOverride-5">’s ‘The Music Issue’ sees Christina Perri rocking out all the hottest </span><span class="CharOverride-7">minkpink</span><span class="CharOverride-5"> trends at legendary LA music studio Mates, where she also recently recorded her eagerly anticipated second album ‘Head &amp; Heart<a id="Anchor-2"></a>’, set to be a smash hit worldwide. With the help of superstar stylist Mark Vassallo and iconic photographer Mike Piscatelli, Christina Perri has put her own </span><span class="CharOverride-9">unique stamp</span><span class="CharOverride-5"> on every look, epitomising what it means to be a </span><span class="CharOverride-7">minkpink</span><span class="CharOverride-5"> girl.</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-5">So why is Miss Perri the ultimate </span><span class="CharOverride-7">minkpink </span><span class="CharOverride-5">babe? Well for us that’s pretty much a no brainer. Not one to be defined by convention, Christina’s unique </span><span class="CharOverride-9">brand of cool</span><span class="CharOverride-5"> is irresistible to anyone who meets her - this is one chick who talks the talk and walks the walk, and has stayed </span><span class="CharOverride-9">true to herself</span><span class="CharOverride-5"> and her style from the get go. With a finger firmly on the pulse of all things fashion, music and social media, Christina’s passion for life is infectious, and her playful demeanour and </span><span class="CharOverride-9">free spirited </span><span class="CharOverride-5">attitude define what it means to live in the moment - it’s practically impossible to take a look at </span><span class="CharOverride-7">minkpink</span><span class="CharOverride-5">’s The Music Issue and not come away feeling just that little bit more </span><span class="CharOverride-9">inspired</span><span class="CharOverride-5">…</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-5">For the love of </span><span class="CharOverride-7">minkpink</span><span class="CharOverride-5">…be brave and free.</span></p>

		<div class="Basic-Text-Frame">
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-10">Christina Perri</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-10">headline here</span></p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-11">August in California, and L.A’s tribe of Beautiful People are flocking to the beaches in their hoards…but for one talented young singer-songwriter, there’s no better place to while away the days than the recording studio. It’s here that Philly-born rock chick and style maven Christina Perri feels most at home, which is why it made perfect sense to choose North Hollywood’s iconic Mates Studios as the location to shoot MINKPINK’s brand new global campaign ‘The Music Issue’, fronted by the stunning songstress herself.</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-11">With her striking, uber-cool look, mane of glossy tresses and multitude of tattoos, it would be easy to feel intimidated by Christina...but in fact she puts us instantly at ease from the moment we meet her, welcoming everyone with such genuine warmness that it’s impossible not to fall in love with her on the spot. A self-confessed jokester with a ‘dorky’ sense of humour, Christina’s megawatt smile and laidback attitude don’t falter throughout MINKPINK’s time with her…but it’s her refreshing openness and honesty that makes us feel like we’ve been BFFs for years. Christina admits that her direct manner and talent for tapping into her emotions is in part down to her heritage (her father is Italian and her mother, Polish), which plays a huge part in her personality ‘I am just SO Italian and loud!’ she laughs as we flick through the racks of MINKPINK clothing that have been selected for the shoot ‘I’m a very open person so I love trying different things’. It’s easy to forget that CP is not a professional model as she strikes up an easy rapport with stylist Mark Vassalo and photographer Mike Piscitelli and rocks out every look with such effortless panache. It’s safe to say we’d definitely be feeling just a touch of the green eyed monster was she not so damn frickin’ likeable! </span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-11">Clearly her latest incarnation as global ambassador for MINKPINK (a brand she describes as ‘one of her all time favourites’) has got Christina seriously hyped ‘I am so honoured to have been chosen’ she squeals ‘it’s like a little dream come true!’, and judging on recent times, this is one style-savvy babe who is no stranger to dreams coming true. Having gone from waitress to worldwide singing sensation in what seems like the blink of an eye, the past three years have seen Christina’s career skyrocket - her previous albums have both gone multiplatinum and her music has featured on the soundtrack of cult movie franchise Twilight as well as hit TV show Glee. With new album ‘Head and Heart’ set for release very soon, we have a feeling this is just the beginning…</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-11">Barely out of nappies when she discovered her love of singing, it was when Christina’s adored older brother Nick left home to pursue his dreams as lead guitarist in band ‘Silvertide’ that her talent as a songwriter was unearthed; ‘I picked up my brother’s old guitar and taught myself because I missed the sound of his playing so much...and then all of a sudden these songs would appear!’ she tells us. But it was her first taste of love at 15 that proved to be the biggest source of inspiration for her music. As they say, the first cut is the deepest…and never was this truer than for Miss Perri. The relationship went through 1001 twists and turns over the course of six years, with its eventual breakdown resulting in Christina penning THAT song – the rest, as they say, is history. On her 21st birthday, Christina packed up her guitar and left the city she had always called home to follow her dreams, 3000 miles away in LA.</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-11">Things weren’t exactly plain sailing from there however. Within months, Christina found herself head over heels in love once again – this time with an LA music producer, who she married following a textbook whirlwind romance. Sadly it wasn’t to be; ‘I was married at 21 and divorced at 22’ she tells us candidly. It’s testament to her character that Christina has managed to stay close to her ex-husband ‘we laugh about it now…it’s like, hey, remember that time when we were married?!’ she smiles. Nevertheless, you get the impression that when Christina falls in love, she falls hard. Perhaps that’s what makes her so relatable…after all, we’ve all been there. She remembers her first love as being ‘a huge milestone’ - one which inspired her first ever tattoo (an ankh on the back of her neck) which she chose to symbolise ‘the first time [she] felt really alive’. It’s obvious that where Christina is concerned there is only one place to wear your heart…and that is firmly on your tattooed sleeve!</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-11">Judging by her album sales and social media following (at last count she had over 450k followers on Instagram alone), Christina’s experiences definitely resonate with many. Of course, life has not been without its hiccups…but it’s these bumps in the road that her fans identify with. ‘When I was growing up I always felt so different…I definitely felt like I didn’t quite fit in’ she says. We can sense a wild child edge to CP’s character - at just 27 years old, she’s already lived a pretty colourful life – but right now, her focus is plain for all to see. These days, she chooses Kale Juice over champagne (politely declining any alcohol on the day of the shoot), and it’s evident she feels a certain level of responsibility towards her fans whom she strives to maintain a constant open line of dialogue with ‘In the first two months [after ‘Jar of Hearts’] I would answer every single email that came in, I would sit every night and read all their stories and write them all back because it made me feel so connected, like I was part of this thing with all these people that we were going through together’. When we ask her, in the midst of such a hectic schedule, where on earth she finds the time she shrugs, explaining simply ‘Well, it’s my favourite thing. Just communicating with the fans’. </span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-11">Following her marriage breakup, Christina turned her focus fully back to singing, penning songs whilst supporting herself with a waitressing job at a coffee house in Beverley Hills. It was after one particularly gruelling shift (most of which she had spent being ‘yelled at’) that she received the call that was to change her life – ‘Jar of Hearts’, the song she wrote about the demise of her First Love, would that night be aired to the nation on TV show ‘So You Think You Can Dance’ after a friend of hers had passed it onto the show’s choreographer. ‘I screamed. Then I cried. Then I called my Mom’ she remembers with a grin.  That’s when the rollercoaster ride really began ‘I had only ever performed at little coffee houses and open mics…and next thing I know I’m on national television on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Then the first show I did was at the Santa Barbara Bowl with Jason Mraz in front of 6000 people!’ It’s pretty mind blowing stuff, and Christina could be forgiven had she gotten a little swept up in her own hype…but instead she comes across as utterly grateful, if a little bedazzled by her new found fame. When asked how she has managed to stay so level headed throughout, she admits ‘I can’t think about it. I just stay connected to my friends and family and don’t take myself too seriously…I think that’s really how I get through it. I am exactly the same person on stage as I am on a night out with friends. I just try to enjoy it.’ </span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-11">We have to say, we admire her outlook…but what really drew MINKPINK to CP straight off the bat was undoubtedly her unique style. Embodying what it means to be a MINKPINK girl, Christina is someone who really Owns It, always up for taking a risk and trying something new. Never the wallflower, she admits to using tattoos - her ‘favourite permanent accessory’ - as a form of creative expression (she is the proud owner of ‘over 65’, but confesses to having lost count of the exact number - a nod to her wilder past perhaps?). ‘I should regret a couple of risqué ones…but I don’t’ she tells us frankly as we admire her left wrist, inked with names of all four Beatles (a band that she describes as one of her ‘biggest sources of inspiration’) and it’s exactly this devil-may-care attitude that makes her so appealing! </span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-11">When it comes to her enviable style, she is modest; ‘any type of ‘style’ I have happened sort of organically’ she tells us ‘I never had any money for clothes growing up so I wore a lot of my brothers or friends clothes, then I’d save up my waitressing money for one rad piece that I’d wear every day’. These days things have changed, and Christina admits she is now ‘obsessed’ with fashion. Although she has always stayed true to her individuality (a look she describes as ‘tomboy-chic’), Christina’s style has naturally evolved. Pre-‘Jar of Hearts’, the singer rarely wore make-up, let alone worked with a stylist or make-up artist, and her standard uniform consisted of black skinny jeans and combat boots. But although her approach to dressing is still pretty low-maintenance, she has learnt to embrace her girly side, and is wide eyed as she describes her first-ever foray into the world of luxury - a pair of coveted Christian Louboutin shoes - confessing ‘THAT was a whole new ball game for me!’. The whirlwind of the past few years has meant more than a few red-carpet appearances for Miss Perri, and although daunting at first, she has learned to embrace these events - even picking up a few style tips along the way;  ‘The more things I go to, the more I love getting dressed up. I find myself checking out what everyone is wearing and making little notes of all the things I want to try – I’m a brand new girl!’ she giggles. </span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-11">Citing everyone from Rihanna to Karen O, Janelle Monae and Miley Cyrus as style influencers, Christina has developed a taste for high end designers (Chanel, Marc Jacobs and Alexander McQueen are particular faves), mastering the art of hi-low dressing along the way. ‘If it feels hip and comfortable, that’s what I’ll wear’ she says of her habit of throwing together expensive pieces with thrift store treasures - a pretty good style ethos if ever we heard one!</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-11">A style icon in the making she may well be, but it’s clear where Christina’s true passion lies, and h<a id="Anchor-3"></a>er face visibly lights up when conversation turns back to music. She talks animatedly about her biggest musical influences (an eclectic line-up that includes everyone from Frank Sinatra, and The Beatles to Lady Gaga, Michael Jackson and Freddie Mercury) and is clearly pumped about the release of her upcoming album ‘Head &amp;Heart’; ‘It’s the most important thing in my life, it’s like a little child to me’ she tells us sincerely ‘It’s a collection of all my stories so it’s real. It’s very real, it’s all true stuff. I couldn’t be more proud of it’. We have to admit we’re pretty intrigued to hear what this one has in store for us…more tales of love gone bad perhaps, or has Christina finally found The One? On this she is a little bit coy ‘I’m in love with a couple of boys’ she admits ‘although I am trying to be single…but I’m letting myself have crushes’. Yep, definitely a girl after our own hearts…</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-11">So, after a whirlwind three years and a dizzying climb to the top…what’s next for Christina Perri? ‘Seriously? I have NO idea!’ she admits ‘but that’s all part of the excitement…right??’</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-11">We couldn’t agree more.</span></p>

			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-11">Want to know the secrets to creating Christina Perri’s stunning look?? Then you’ve come to the right place! We caught up Christina’s go-to beauty maestro Giavonna Brascia who gave us the lowdown on achieving CP’s old-Hollywood-meets-rock’n’roll glow in just a few easy steps!</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-11">We know, we know…we’re just too good to you! </span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-21">skin</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-11">‘Right now, Christina is OBSESSED with Elemental Herbology products. No matter how busy she is, she makes sure she uses their cleanser, cell food and moisturiser day and night to keep her skin in tip top condition. It’s especially important for Christina to keep up the routine when she is travelling through different time zones as this can wreak havoc with her complexion.’</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-21">beauty</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-11">‘One of my favourite things about working with Christina is how open she is to playing around with different looks – although she’s a natural beauty, so we never need to take it to extremes. Christina loves shimmer on her eyes, so I use M.A.C’s Skinfinish in Soft and Gentle along her brow bone and the inner part of her eye which gives a glow as well as adding gorgeous sparkle. Sometimes we like to mix that up with a cream shadow like Chanel Illusion d’Ombre Long-Wear Eyeshadow in Fatal (837) which really adds depth to the eyes.</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-11">Because of Christina’s beautiful Mediterranean colouring, we tend to mostly stick to a warm, neutral pallet of bronzes and browns, with peachy blush colours on her cheeks. We’ll vary the drama depending on the occasion – for example, Christina’s a big fan of a smoky eye, so we build that up with deep bronze shades to achieve her red-carpet look. We also like to accentuate her amazing eyelashes with mascara – Yves Saint Laurent Faux Cils is her fave.</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-11">Recently, Christina’s started playing around a bit more with colour – at the moment she’s loving a bright pink lip which really pops to give her a look that’s just that little bit different. For the MINKPINK: The Music Issue shoot we used M.A.C lipsticks in ‘Pink Plaid’ and ‘Lustering’, which worked really well with her skin tone. </span></p>

Read on to find out how you can create a glossy, Rapunzelesque bonce to rival MINKPINK babe Christina’s in just a few easy steps…</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-4"><span class="CharOverride-24">n </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Start with freshly washed hair and spray in a styling product that gives both volume and hold – try Aveda Pure Abundance Style Prep.</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-4"><span class="CharOverride-24">n </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Set your hairdryer to high heat and flip your head over, then blast til your hair is around 70% dry.</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-4"><span class="CharOverride-24">n </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Separate the hair into four horizontal sections and clip into place. Grab a large, round barrel brush and start working on the bottom tier, angling your hair dryer nozzle down so it smooths the hair out. This keeps the cuticles flat, putting a stop to any annoying flyaways.</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-4"><span class="CharOverride-24">n </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Move up through the sections until hair <br />is completely dry and relatively smooth, <br />paying particular attention to the roots. Use a tail comb to create a neat side part for that real Old Hollywood glamour look.</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-4"><span class="CharOverride-24">n </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Grab horizontal sections of hair from across the back of the head, approx. 5cm in width. Then, using a large curling tong (our fave is the Babyliss Pro Ceramic 32mm Curling Tong), break the sections up and wrap the hair around the barrel in a spiral form. Hold for around 30-40 seconds</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-4"><span class="CharOverride-24">n </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Carry on with this technique throughout all sections. Once you get to the upper sections, wrap the hair around the tongs from around cheekbone level to avoid too much volume at the crown.</span></p>
			<p class="ParaOverride-4"><span class="CharOverride-24">n </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Let the hair cool for a few seconds, then loosed the waves with your fingertips. Blast with a light holding spray such as Aveda Air Control Hairspray to finish. Get ready to Rock It gurrrrl!</span></p>
