</h4>

In the mood to rock out your fancy pants? Then flap those social butterfly wings and get chummy with a member of the elite Soho House gang. With venues in some of the world’s most amazing cities (we’re talking London, New York and Miami to name but a few), the West Hollywood branch of this exclusive members-only club is situated in a penthouse position smack bang in the middle of the iconic Sunset Boulevard. Offering unrivalled panoramic views across the entire city, this is the perfect spot to kick back with a cocktail and watch the sun set over the City of Angels.

	LIVE LIKE A MOVIE STAR:
  <a class="place" href="http://www.chateaumarmont.com/" data-link-id="links:7" target="_blank">Chateau Marmont</a>
</h4>

Uber cool Chateau Marmont is the ultimate spot to see and be seen at in
L.A. The legendary castle-like hotel has played host to its fair share of stars and scandals over the years, but still upholds its reputation as one of the sickest hangouts in town. A regular haunt of stars such as Johnny Depp and The Rolling Stones, we’d give our right arm to hear those walls talk! Channel your inner Miss Monroe in one of their luxury suites, or simply settle in at the bar and soak up the heady blend of Old- Hollywood-meets-Modern-Day-LA.
