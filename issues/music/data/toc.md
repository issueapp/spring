OK, I admit it. I’m maybe just a teeeny bit obsessed with <span>MINKPINK</span>…so it’s safe to say I was over-the-frickin’-moon when they asked me to front their latest international campaign ‘<span>MINKPINK</span>: <big>The Music Issue!</big> <span>MINKPINK</span> are always pretty out there when it comes to getting creative, so I knew working together would be a lot of fun...although I have to admit, I was a little nervous about the whole modelling thing. 

Being a singer, that’s kind of a foreign world to me! The best piece of advice I’ve ever been given is ‘you’re enough just the way you are’ , and although I try to remember that, it’s not always easy! Luckily, I got to work with an absolute Dream Team (BIG shout out to photographer Mike Piscitelli and super stylist Mark Vassallo!), who made me feel so comfortable just fooling around and being
myself on the day of the shoot! Of course, the fact that I LOVED literally every piece of <span>MINKPINK</span> clothing I got to wear also couldn’t have hurt – seriously, you guys are going to be spoiled for choice!

I’ve had a blast working with <span>MINKPINK</span>, and what’s even better is that now I get to share the campaign as well as a whole heap of other awesome stuff with you, via <span>MINKPINK</span>: <big>The Music Issue</big>. This is <span>MINKPINK</span>’s first EVER magazine and I’m so excited to have been a part of it…I have a feeling you’re going to love reading it as much as we loved putting it together!<br>Race you to the checkout…!

Love,
