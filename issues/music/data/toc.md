Welcome to minkpink: The Music Issue!!

Now I know I’m not alone in saying this, but I am just a teeeeny bit OBSESSED with minkpink…so you can imagine how over-the-frickin’-moon I was when they asked me to front their latest international campaign ‘minkpink: The Music Issue!’. Working on the campaign has been a blast, but what’s even better is that now I get to share it with all of you!

Right off the bat I’ve felt a connection to minkpink. I love the way they constantly push the boundaries when it comes to all things creative - it’s something I am always striving to do in my own career, so to be able to work with a brand with that same outlook is pretty exciting.
This time round, they’ve come up with the brain-achingly awesome idea of presenting the entire campaign in this magazine, jampacked with heaps of content including the official campaign shoot and tons of exclusive behind-the-scenes footage, meaning you get to feast your eyes on the latest rad minkpink threads all in one go! You’ll also find a little interview with Yours Truly, top-secret beauty tips from the industry’s hottest experts, and an insider’s guide to all the sickest spots to hit up in our shoot location, Los Angeles. Ummm spoiled, much?!

I hope you enjoy checking out minkpink: The Music Issue as much as we enjoyed putting it together (I kinda have a feeling you will )! And now for the tough decisions…what to buy first?!
Race you to the checkout…!

Love,
