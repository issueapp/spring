### SKIN

‘Right now, Christina is OBSESSED with Elemental Herbology products. No matter how busy she is, she makes sure she uses their cleanser, cell food and moisturiser day and night to keep her skin in tip top condition. It’s especially important for Christina to keep up the routine when she is travelling through different time zones, as that can wreak havoc with her complexion.’
