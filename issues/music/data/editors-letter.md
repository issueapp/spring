<span>MINKPINK</span> have done it again with the launch of <span>MINKPINK</span>: The Music Issue, combining two of everyone’s favourite
things – BIG tunes and faaaaarshion baby – to produce one rad global campaign…and who better to front it than music’s
latest maverick, the inked-up brunette bombshell with the megawatt smile that is <big>Christina Perri</big>?! With a killer look
and a voice that is guaranteed to melt even the iciest of hearts, <span>MINKPINK</span> are beyond stoked to have tapped this one up! An alternative Disney princess in her very own <big>modern day fairy tale</big>, Christina shot to fame in 2010 when
her song ‘Jar of Hearts’ (just a little ditty she penned whilst sitting in her bedroom in her PJs one day) became a global
smash hit after it was picked up by choreographer Stacey Tookey and played on US TV show ‘So You Think You
Can Dance’. Since then, it’s been a head spinningly <big>crazy ride</big> for uber-talented singer-songwriter Christina…
and it shows no signs of slowing!


<span>MINKPINK</span>’s ‘The Music Issue’ sees Christina Perri rocking out all the hottest <span>MINKPINK</span> trends at legendary LA music studio Mates, where she also recently recorded her eagerly anticipated second album ‘Head & Heart’, set to be a smash hit worldwide. With the help of superstar stylist Mark Vassallo and iconic photographer Mike Piscatelli, Christina Perri has put her own <big>unique stamp</big> on every look. 

So why is Miss Perri the ultimate <span>MINKPINK</span> babe? Well for us that’s pretty much a no brainer. Not one to be defined by convention, Christina’s unique <big>brand of cool</big> is irresistible to anyone who meets her - this is one chick who talks the talk and walks the walk, and has stayed <big>true to herself</big> and her style from the get go. With a finger firmly on the pulse of all things fashion, music and social media, Christina’s passion for life is infectious, and her playful demeanour and <big>free spirited</big> attitude define what it means to live in the moment.
