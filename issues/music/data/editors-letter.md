Minkpink have done it again with the launch of the The Music Issue, combining two of everyone’s favourite things – BIG tunes and faaaaarshion baby – to produce one rad global campaign…and who better to front it than music’s latest maverick, the inked-up brunette bombshell with the megawatt smile that is Christina Perri?! With a killer look and a voice that is guaranteed to melt evenx the iciest of hearts, minkpink are beyond stoked to have tapped this one up!
An alternative Disney princess in her very own modern day fairy tale, Christina shot to fame in 2010 when 
her song ‘Jar of Hearts’ (just a little ditty she penned whilst sitting in her bedroom in her PJs one day) became a global 
smash hit after it was picked up by choreographer Stacey Tookey and played on US TV show ‘So You Think You Can Dance’. Since then, it’s been a head spinningly crazy ride for uber-talented singer-songwriter Christina…and it 
shows no signs of slowing!

minkpink’s ‘The Music Issue’ sees Christina Perri rocking out all the hottest minkpink trends at legendary LA music studio Mates, where she also recently recorded her eagerly anticipated second album ‘Head & Heart’, set to be a smash hit worldwide. With the help of superstar stylist Mark Vassallo and iconic photographer Mike Piscatelli, Christina Perri has put her own unique stamp on every look, epitomising what it means to be a minkpink girl.
So why is Miss Perri the ultimate minkpink babe? Well for us that’s pretty much a no brainer. Not one to be defined by convention, Christina’s unique brand of cool is irresistible to anyone who meets her - this is one chick who talks the talk and walks the walk, and has stayed true to herself and her style from the get go. With a finger firmly on the pulse of all things fashion, music and social media, Christina’s passion for life is infectious, and her playful demeanour and free spirited attitude define what it means to live in the moment - it’s practically impossible to take a look at minkpink’s The Music Issue and not come away feeling just that little bit more inspired…
For the love of minkpink…be brave and free.
