With her striking, uber-cool look, mane of glossy tresses and multitude of tattoos, it would be easy to feel intimidated by Christina...but in fact she puts us instantly at ease from the moment we meet her, welcoming everyone with such genuine warmness that it’s impossible not to fall in love with her on the spot. A self-confessed jokester with a ‘dorky’ sense of humour, Christina’s megawatt smile and laidback attitude don’t falter throughout MINKPINK’s time with her…but it’s her refreshing openness and honesty that makes us feel like we’ve been BFFs for years. Christina admits that her direct manner and talent for tapping into her emotions is in part down to her heritage (her father is Italian and her mother, Polish), which plays a huge part in her personality ‘I am just SO Italian and loud!’ she laughs as we flick through the racks of MINKPINK clothing that have been selected for the shoot ‘I’m a very open person so I love trying different things’. It’s easy to forget that CP is not a professional model as she strikes up an easy rapport with stylist Mark Vassalo and photographer Mike Piscitelli and rocks out every look with such effortless panache. It’s safe to say we’d definitely be feeling just a touch of the green eyed monster was she not so damn frickin’ likeable!

Clearly her latest incarnation as global ambassador for MINKPINK (a brand she describes as ‘one of her all time favourites’) has got Christina seriously hyped ‘I am so honoured to have been chosen’ she squeals ‘it’s like a little dream come true!’, and judging on recent times, this is one style-savvy babe who is no stranger to dreams coming true. Having gone from waitress to worldwide singing sensation in what seems like the blink of an eye, the past three years have seen Christina’s career skyrocket - her previous albums have both gone multiplatinum and her music has featured on the soundtrack of cult movie franchise <span>Twilight</span> as well as hit TV show <span>Glee</span>. With new album <span>Head or Heart</span> set for release very soon, we have a feeling this is just the beginning…

Barely out of nappies when she discovered her love of singing, it was when Christina’s adored older brother Nick left home to pursue his dreams as lead guitarist in band <span>Silvertide</span> that her talent as a songwriter was unearthed; ‘I picked up my brother’s old guitar and taught myself because I missed the sound of his playing so much...and then all of a sudden these songs would appear!’ she tells us. But it was her first taste of love at 15 that proved to be the biggest source of inspiration for her music. As they say, the first cut is the deepest…and never was this truer than for Miss Perri. The relationship went through 1001 twists and turns over the course of six years, with its eventual breakdown resulting in Christina penning THAT song – the rest, as they say, is history. On her 21st birthday, Christina packed up her guitar and left the city she had always called home to follow her dreams, 3000 miles away in LA.

Things weren’t exactly plain sailing from there however. Within months, Christina found herself head over heels in love once again – this time with an LA music producer, who she married following a textbook whirlwind romance. Sadly it wasn’t to be; ‘I was married at 21 and divorced at 22’ she tells us candidly. It’s testament to her character that Christina has managed to stay close to her ex-husband ‘we laugh about it now…it’s like, hey, remember that time when we were married?!’ she smiles. Nevertheless, you get the impression that when Christina falls in love, she falls hard. Perhaps that’s what makes her so relatable…after all, we’ve all been there. She remembers her first love as being ‘a huge milestone’ - one which inspired her first ever tattoo (an ankh on the back of her neck) which she chose to symbolise ‘the first time [she] felt really alive’. It’s obvious that where Christina is concerned there is only one place to wear your heart…and that is firmly on your tattooed sleeve!

Judging by her album sales and social media following (at last count she had over 450k followers on Instagram alone), Christina’s experiences definitely resonate with many. Of course, life has not been without its hiccups…but it’s these bumps in the road that her fans identify with. ‘When I was growing up I always felt so different…I definitely felt like I didn’t quite fit in’ she says. We can sense a wild child edge to CP’s character - at just 27 years old, she’s already lived a pretty colourful life – but right now, her focus is plain for all to see. These days, she chooses Kale Juice over champagne (politely declining any alcohol on the day of the shoot), and it’s evident she feels a certain level of responsibility towards her fans whom she strives to maintain a constant open line of dialogue with ‘In the first two months [after <span>Jar of Hearts</span>] I would answer every single email that came in, I would sit every night and read all their stories and write them all back because it made me feel so connected, like I was part of this thing with all these people that we were going through together’. When we ask her, in the midst of such a hectic schedule, where on earth she finds the time she shrugs, explaining simply ‘Well, it’s my favourite thing. Just communicating with the fans’.


Following her marriage breakup, Christina turned her focus fully back to singing, penning songs whilst supporting herself with a waitressing job at a coffee house in Beverley Hills. It was after one particularly gruelling shift (most of which she had spent being ‘yelled at’) that she received the call that was to change her life – <span>Jar of Hearts</span>, the song she wrote about the demise of her First Love, would that night be aired to the nation on TV show <span>So You Think You Can Dance</span> after a friend of hers had passed it onto the show’s choreographer. ‘I screamed. Then I cried. Then I called my Mom’ she remembers with a grin. That’s when the rollercoaster ride really began ‘I had only ever performed at little coffee houses and open mics…and next thing I know I’m on national television on <span>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</span>. Then the first show I did was at the Santa Barbara Bowl with Jason Mraz in front of 6000 people!’ It’s pretty mind blowing stuff, and Christina could be forgiven had she gotten a little swept up in her own hype…but instead she comes across as utterly grateful, if a little bedazzled by her new found fame. When asked how she has managed to stay so level headed throughout, she admits ‘I can’t think about it. I just stay connected to my friends and family and don’t take myself too seriously…I think that’s really how I get through it. I am exactly the same person on stage as I am on a night out with friends. I just try to enjoy it.’

We have to say, we admire her outlook…but what really drew MINKPINK to CP straight off the bat was undoubtedly her unique style. Embodying what it means to be a MINKPINK girl, Christina is someone who really Owns It, always up for taking a risk and trying something new. Never the wallflower, she admits to using tattoos - her ‘favourite permanent accessory’ - as a form of creative expression (she is the proud owner of ‘over 65’, but confesses to having lost count of the exact number - a nod to her wilder past perhaps?). ‘I should regret a couple of risqué ones…but I don’t’ she tells us frankly as we admire her left wrist, inked with names of all four Beatles (a band that she describes as one of her ‘biggest sources of inspiration’) and it’s exactly this devil-may-care attitude that makes her so appealing!

When it comes to her enviable style, she is modest; ‘any type of ‘style’ I have happened sort of organically’ she tells us ‘I never had any money for clothes growing up so I wore a lot of my brothers or friends clothes, then I’d save up my waitressing money for one rad piece that I’d wear every day’. These days things have changed, and Christina admits she is now ‘obsessed’ with fashion. Although she has always stayed true to her individuality (a look she describes as ‘tomboy-chic’), Christina’s style has naturally evolved. Pre-<span>Jar of Hearts</span>, the singer rarely wore make-up, let alone worked with a stylist or make-up artist, and her standard uniform consisted of black skinny jeans and combat boots. But although her approach to dressing is still pretty low-maintenance, she has learnt to embrace her girly side, and is wide eyed as she describes her first-ever foray into the world of luxury - a pair of coveted Christian Louboutin shoes - confessing ‘THAT was a whole new ball game for me!’. The whirlwind of the past few years has meant more than a few red-carpet appearances for Miss Perri, and although daunting at first, she has learned to embrace these events - even picking up a few style tips along the way; ‘The more things I go to, the more I love getting dressed up. I find myself checking out what everyone is wearing and making little notes of all the things I want to try – I’m a brand new girl!’ she giggles.

Citing everyone from Rihanna to Karen O, Janelle Monae and Miley Cyrus as style influencers, Christina has developed a taste for high end designers (Chanel, Marc Jacobs and Alexander McQueen are particular faves), mastering the art of hi-low dressing along the way. ‘If it feels hip and comfortable, that’s what I’ll wear’ she says of her habit of throwing together expensive pieces with thrift store treasures - a pretty good style ethos if ever we heard one!

A style icon in the making she may well be, but it’s clear where Christina’s true passion lies, and her face visibly lights up when conversation turns back to music. She talks animatedly about her biggest musical influences (an eclectic line-up that includes everyone from Frank Sinatra, and The Beatles to Lady Gaga, Michael Jackson and Freddie Mercury) and is clearly pumped about the release of her upcoming album <span>Head or Heart</span>; ‘It’s the most important thing in my life, it’s like a little child to me’ she tells us sincerely ‘It’s a collection of all my stories so it’s real. It’s very real, it’s all true stuff. I couldn’t be more proud of it’. We have to admit we’re pretty intrigued to hear what this one has in store for us…more tales of love gone bad perhaps, or has Christina finally found The One? On this she is a little bit coy ‘I’m in love with a couple of boys’ she admits ‘although I <span>am</span> trying to be single…but I’m letting myself have crushes’. Yep, definitely a girl after our own hearts…
So, after a whirlwind three years and a dizzying climb to the top…what’s next for Christina Perri? ‘Seriously? I have NO idea!’ she admits ‘but that’s all part of the excitement…right??’
We couldn’t agree more.
