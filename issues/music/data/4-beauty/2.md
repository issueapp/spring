<span>Sadly, we didn’t all hit the jackpot genepool and land a mane as luscious as Miss Perri’s…but that doesn’t mean we can’t at least attempt to tame our tresses into the same vision of loveliness! Read on to find out how you can create a glossy, Rapunzelesque bonce to rival MINKPINK babe Christina’s in just a few easy steps…</span>

<span>- Start with freshly washed hair and spray in a styling product that gives both volume and hold - try Aveda Pure Abundance Style Prep.</span>

<span>- Set your hairdryer to high heat and flip your head over, then blast til your hair is around 70% dry.</span>

<span>- Separate the hair into four horizontal sections and clip into place. Grab a large, round barrel brush and start working on the bottom tier, angling your hair dryer nozzle down so it smoothes the hair out. This keeps the cuticles flat, putting a stop to any annoying flyaways.</span>

<span>- Move up through the sections until hair is completely dry and relatively smooth, paying particular attention to the roots. Use
a tail comb to create a neat side part for that real Old Hollywood glamour look.</span>

<span>- Take horizontal sections of hair from across the back of the head, approx. 5cm in width. Then, using a large curling tong (our fave is the Babyliss Pro Ceramic 32mm Curling Tong), break the sections up and wrap the hair around the barrel in a spiral form. Hold for around 30-40 seconds.</span>

<span>- Carry on with this technique throughout all sections. Once you get to the upper sections, wrap the hair around the tongs from around cheekbone level to avoid too much volume at the crown.</span>

<span>- Let the hair cool for a few seconds, then loosen the waves with your fingertips. Blast with a light holding spray such as Aveda Air Control Hairspray to finish. Get ready to ROCK IT gurrrrl!</span>
