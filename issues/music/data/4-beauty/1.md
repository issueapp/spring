<h3>BEAUTY</h3>

‘One of my favourite things about working with Christina is how open she is to playing around with different looks – she’s a natural
beauty though, so we never need to take it to extremes. Christina loves shimmer on her eyes, so I use M.A.C Mineralize Skinfinish in Soft and Gentle along her brow bone and the inner part of her eye, which gives a glow as well as adding gorgeous sparkle. Sometimes we like to mix that up with a cream shadow like Chanel Illusion d’Ombre Long-Wear Eyeshadow in Fatal (837) to really add depth to the eyes.

Because of Christina’s beautifully warm, Mediterranean colouring, we tend to mostly stick to a neutral palette of bronzes and
browns, with peachy blush colours on her cheeks. We’ll vary the drama depending on the occasion – for example, Christina’s a big fan of a smoky eye, so we build that up with deep bronze shades to achieve her redcarpet look. She also likes to accentuate her amazing eyelashes with mascara – Yves Saint Laurent Faux Cils is her fave.

Recently, Christina’s started playing around a bit more with colour – at the moment she’s loving a bright pink lip which really pops to give her everyday look a bit of a twist. For the MINKPINK: The Music Issue shoot we used M.A.C lipsticks in <em>Pink Plaid</em> and <em>Lustering</em>, which worked really well with her skin tone.

<h3>SKIN</h3>

‘Right now, Christina is OBSESSED with Elemental Herbology products. No matter how busy she is, she makes sure she uses their cleanser, cell food and moisturiser day and night to keep her skin in tip top condition. It’s especially important for Christina to keep up the routine when she is travelling through different time zones, as that can wreak havoc with her complexion.’

<h3>HAIR</h3>

Sadly, we didn’t all hit the jackpot genepool and land a mane as luscious as Miss Perri’s…but that doesn’t mean we can’t at least attempt to tame our tresses into the same vision of loveliness! Read on to find out how you can create a glossy, Rapunzelesque bonce to rival MINKPINK babe Christina’s in just a few easy steps…

- Start with freshly washed hair and spray in a styling product that gives both volume and hold - try Aveda Pure Abundance Style Prep.

- Set your hairdryer to high heat and flip your head over, then blast til your hair is around 70% dry.

- Separate the hair into four horizontal sections and clip into place. Grab a large, round barrel brush and start working on the bottom tier, angling your hair dryer nozzle down so it smoothes the hair out. This keeps the cuticles flat, putting a stop to any annoying flyaways.

- Move up through the sections until hair is completely dry and relatively smooth, paying particular attention to the roots. Use a tail comb to create a neat side part for that real Old Hollywood glamour look.

- Take horizontal sections of hair from across the back of the head, approx. 5cm in width. Then, using a large curling tong (our fave is the Babyliss Pro Ceramic 32mm Curling Tong), break the sections up and wrap the hair around the barrel in a spiral form. Hold for around 30-40 seconds.

- Carry on with this technique throughout all sections. Once you get to the upper sections, wrap the hair around the tongs from around cheekbone level to avoid too much volume at the crown.

- Let the hair cool for a few seconds, then loosen the waves with your fingertips. Blast with a light holding spray such as Aveda Air Control Hairspray to finish. Get ready to ROCK IT gurrrrl!
