##SKIN

‘Right now, Christina is OBSESSED with Elemental Herbology products. No matter how busy she is, she makes sure she uses their cleanser, cell food and moisturiser day and night to keep her skin in tip top condition. It’s especially important for Christina to keep up the routine when she is travelling through different time zones, as that can wreak havoc with her complexion.’

##BEAUTY

‘One of my favourite things about working with Christina is how open she is to playing around with different looks – she’s a natural
beauty though, so we never need to take it to extremes. Christina loves shimmer on her eyes, so I use M.A.C Mineralize Skinfinish in Soft and Gentle along her brow bone and the inner part of her eye, which gives a glow as well as adding gorgeous sparkle. Sometimes we like to mix that up with a cream shadow like Chanel Illusion d’Ombre Long-Wear Eyeshadow in Fatal (837) to really add depth to the eyes.

Because of Christina’s beautifully warm, Mediterranean colouring, we tend to mostly stick to a neutral palette of bronzes and
browns, with peachy blush colours on her cheeks. We’ll vary the drama depending on the occasion – for example, Christina’s a big fan of a smoky eye, so we build that up with deep bronze shades to achieve her redcarpet look. She also likes to accentuate her amazing eyelashes with mascara – Yves Saint Laurent Faux Cils is her fave.

Recently, Christina’s started playing around a bit more with colour – at the moment she’s loving a bright pink lip which really pops to give her everyday look a bit of a twist. For the MINKPINK: The Music Issue shoot we used M.A.C lipsticks in <em>Pink Plaid</em> and <em>Lustering</em>, which worked really well with her skin tone.
