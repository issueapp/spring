<h2>CP TALKS MUSIC AND SPILLS ON HER LATEST ALBUM 'HEAD OR HEART'</h2>

Where did the name for your new album come from?

Head or Heart is all about learning which gut instinct to trust. Do you go with your head or your heart? It’s a question I think all girls ask themselves at one time or another. So each song is either a ‘head’ song or a ‘heart’ song...it’s up to you to decide!

Where was the album recorded?

I’m pretty lucky on this...I got the chance to record in London, LA and New York, which was awesome because travelling and seeing new places is totally one of my favourite things – and a huge source of inspiration!

Who produced the album?

I worked with a few producers on Head or Heart, including Butch Walker, John Hill and Jamie Scott, but the majority was done by my favourite person, the amazing Jake Gosling. We have an unbelievable connection and really understand each other which makes working together sooo easy!

Any musical collaborations you can share with us?

Actually yes, there are a couple! I worked with Jack Antanoff from the band FUN as well as Ed Sheeran which was so exciting! They’re both super talented guys and I absolutely adore them – I can’t wait for people to hear the tracks!
