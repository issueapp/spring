    description: August in California, and L.A’s tribe of Beautiful People are flocking to the beaches in their hoards…but for one talented young singer-songwriter, there’s no better place to while away the days than the recording studio. It’s here that Philly-born rock chick and style maven Christina Perri feels most at home, which is why it made perfect sense to choose North Hollywood’s iconic Mates Studios as the location to shoot MINKPINK’s brand new global campaign _The Music Issue_ , fronted by the stunning songstress herself.
