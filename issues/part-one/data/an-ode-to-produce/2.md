  “The view of the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge still takes my breath away. We’re so lucky to live in this amazing, incredible city with this phenomenal harbour.”

More like an art installation than a glass-walled meat larder, the charcuterie room features high quality artisan terrines and a fantastic range of bespoke, award-winning cured meats selected by Matt Moran. They will be sliced to order on a massive, traditional Berkel meat-slicer. “I’ve always wanted a big Berkel so I put it in the tender and when we won, I had to buy one,” laughs Moran. “Sitting at the bar watching the amazing meat being sliced and then  grazing on great salami, bresaola and prosciutto – it’s a wonderful way to eat. And it’s especially good if you’re not overly hungry but you want to try some – or you’re on a paleo diet!”

Likewise, the best local seafood is displayed in all its glory at the ice-covered Raw Bar. Pull up a stool and watch oysters from half a dozen different regions being shucked to order, or tuck into a piece of premium Hiramasa Kingfish sashimi. “There’s nothing better than great local seafood such as a bucket of prawns or some fresh oysters,” says Moran, “especially when you’re looking over Sydney Harbour. But it’s not just the simple stuff - we’re also doing things like cured trout and salmon and tuna with dressings.”

And while the menu and fitout of Opera Bar are moving upmarket, the setting still sparkles. “Walking around here everyday, you sometimes to forget where you are,” says Moran, “But the view of the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge still takes my breath away. We’re so lucky to live in this amazing, incredible city with this phenomenal harbour.”
