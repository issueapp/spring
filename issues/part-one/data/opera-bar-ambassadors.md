### °Where do you find the most inspiration?
Normally in conflict either with people or with what I see around me. Sometimes I want to write a song because everything I’ve heard that day is so terrible. Sometimes it’s born out of a frustration to hear what I want to hear because I’m not hearing it anywhere else. Or a conflict within myself - wanting to get to the crux of something that I’m feeling and writing about it is a way of interrogating that.

### °What’s the strangest place you’ve played?
I think Alice Springs. It’s just an unusual place. My band and I had just flown in from Amsterdam straight to Alice for a Triple J festival - it was a very strange experience.

### °What does an average day look like?
Recording in London is the most routine I have. It’s wake up, get a matcha latte (I’m off the bean and it’s great), then I get the bus, then the overground to the studio and sit in there for 9 hours and sweat over music. Then I reverse it and have a miso soup and a wine and go to bed. Back in Sydney, my diet is a bit more varied in terms of what I do.

### °Favourite secret Sydney spot?
It’s Lady Bay, the nudist beach near Camp Cove. It’s like being in a huge queue for the women's bathroom and then realising there’s this other loo right next door that’s never used. OK, so you have to get used to some nudity but it’s this totally peaceful beach just a few hundred metres from the madness of Watson’s Bay and Camp Cove. It’s my favourite place in Sydney - I go there all the time.

### °What sums up Sydney in summer?
The long days when it’s about 7 o’clock and everyone’s up on some balcony having a beer with a mate. I feel like if you live in Sydney when it’s cold you’re in denial about it - that’s why people wear scarves and thongs! But in summer that’s the fullest expression of why we chose to live in Sydney.

### °What can’t you live without?
My phone.

### °What three songs would be on a mixed tape for a beer by the harbour with mates?
I Just Grew Tired by Black, something off the new Alt-J record and some Chet Faker.

### °If you were down to your last $50 what you spend it on?
A reverse charge call to my parents asking for cash. And I’d spend the change on a lovely bottle of wine.
