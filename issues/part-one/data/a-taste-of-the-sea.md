There’s nothing better in summer than tucking into some amazing local seafood with a bunch of friends. This summer, take a little inspiration from Opera Bar’s menu and wow your mates with this simple recipe staring wonderful Western Australian scampi.

Scampi are small crustaceans with delicious, sweet flesh. Serving them with their cleaned heads as trimming will be a real summer showstopper - and that's before anyone has tasted the scampi dressed up with refreshing flavours of lime, chilli and chives.
