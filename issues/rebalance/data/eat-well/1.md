    <p>A smoothie is a great way to get your daily dose of vitamins and minerals. Here are some tips to help you nail the perfect smoothie, every time.</p>

    <h3>1. FREEZE YOUR FRUIT</h3>
    <p>Keep a supply of frozen fruit in your freezer so you always have some ready to go. Freezing will help your fruit retain its nutritional value and keep your smoothie nice and chilled.</p>
    <h3>2. ADD SOME BODY</h3>
    <p>Smoothies taste better when they’re thick and creamy, so include something that will thicken the mix, and up the goodness factor, like Pure by Activia yoghurt.</p>
    <h3>3. TRY OUT NEW RECIPES</h3>
    <p>There are so many healthy ingredients you can experiment with, so don’t feel limited to the same old recipes. Even something as simple as a sprinkle of cinnamon can give your smoothie a whole new flavour.</p>
    <h3>4. BLITZ THE BLEND</h3>
    <p>When you’ve got all your ingredients together and you’re ready to blend, start on a low speed and work up to high. Make sure your ingredients are circulating well and any lumps have been taken care of before stopping.</p>
