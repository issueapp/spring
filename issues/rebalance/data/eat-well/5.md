    <p>When youâ€™re in a rush to get out the door it can be tempting to skip breakfast. But a good breakfast provides us with the key vitamins, minerals and nutrients we need to leap into our day and be our brightest, sparkling selves.</p>
    <p>Healthy breakkie options include fruit and veggies, starchy foods (go for fibre rich and low sugar/fat wholegrains), low fat milk and dairy (e.g. yogurt or cheese) and non-dairy protein (e.g. eggs). Breakfast is also the perfect time to work in probiotic-rich foods like Pure by Activia yoghurt. Enjoy it on its own or add it to your smoothie, fruit or muesli.</p>

      <p>You can eat Pure by Activia straight from the tub for a quick breakfast or add it to your smoothie, fruit or muesli for a delicious, creamy flavour hit.</p>
