<p>Along with poor diet and lack of exercise, stress is known to be a major source of digestive issues. Want to eliminate stress? Make some time for yourself, each and every day.</p>

<p>Whether it’s a yoga class, a pampering session or just chilling out listening to your favourite music, it all helps clear your mind and restore a sense of calm. Next time you feel the stress building up, count to ten and take three to five deep breaths. Then find something that makes you happy! Hug a loved one or smell a beautiful flower – you’ll be surprised at how much it can help.</p>
