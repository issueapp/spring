    <p>Getting outside and spending some time in nature is another great stress buster. Not only does it force us to exercise a little (which is a stress- reliever in its own right), it gives us the chance to soak up some vitamin D, which is important for our overall health and wellbeing.</p>
    <p>While the scents, sounds and sights of nature can all be wonderfully soothing, being outside also gives you the opportunity to interract with friends and neighbours you wouldn’t catch inside – and this can help keep your spirits high too.</p>
    <p>Here are some ways to break up your routine and get outside more often:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Skip your afternoon coffee and get your 3pm buzz from a blissful walk in nature instead.</li>
      <li>Keep a picnic rug at work and enjoy your lunches outside.</li>
      <li>Try to schedule ‘moving meetings’ that involve a walk outside, rather than the traditional ‘sit down’ style.</li>
    </ul>
