You’ve probably noticed a surge of words like kimchi, koji and kombucha sprouting up all over the place – from cafe menus to wellness blogs. While you may have only heard of them for the first time recently, these funky foods aren’t a fad. Cultures around the world have been chowing down on fermented foods for centuries – from sauerkraut in Germany to kimchi in Korea. So what are fermented foods exactly, and why would you want to eat them?

Fermented foods are those foods that have gone through a process of lactofermentation. At its most basic level, this process encourages the growth of friendly bacteria which  feed on the sugar and starch in the food, creating lactic acid. The end result is a food rich in probiotics, enzymes, vitamins and minerals, with big benefits for your gut.Eating these fermented foods can help you improve the balance of bacteria in your digestive system, and even help you absorb more of the nutrients from the other foods you eat.

Incorporating more fermented foods in your diet is really easy! Why not have a go at fermenting your own foods at home? A basic sauerkraut recipe can be made using three simple ingredients –cabbage, water and salt. Kombucha and water kefir are also inexpensive to make and can be carbonated to make a refreshing soda.
