      <h2>1. YOUR DIGESTIVE MICROFLORA IS AS INDIVIDUAL AS YOUR FINGERPRINT.</h2>
      <p>Microflora are the microbial bacteria and fungi than inhabit your gastrointestinal system. They assist with digestion and play an important role in the immune system. The microflora within each of us is extremely diverse and this comes down to differences in our genetics, environment, diet and noenatal exposure.</p>

      <h2>2. THERE ARE OVER 25 DISEASES LINKED TO IMBALANCES IN THE GUT.</h2>
      <p>Keeping our digestive system in good working order is essential for our overall health and wellbeing. Though still in it’s infancy, recent research even suggests that our gut may be the key to understanding everything from skin disorders, to mental issues to diabetes, autism and asthma.</p>

      <h2>3. CAUSES OF GUT ISSUES</h2>
      <p>Problems with digestive discomfort can result from a number of lifestyle factors such as stress, lack of exercise, changing habits or an unbalanced diet. With all the demands of a busy, modern life, it’s little wonder digestive discomfort is something we experience from time to time.</p>

      <h2>4. SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM?</h2>
      <p>Your digestive system is an extremely complex environment that performs many vital functions. It’s responsible for breaking down food and delivering nutrients to cells via the bloodstream. It’s comprised of the stomach, small intestine, pancreas, liver and large intestine (bowel). It’s also inhabited by a large reservoir of microbes such as bacteria, which play an vital role in healthy digestion.</p>

      <h2>5. THE ROLE OF THE LARGE INTESTINE</h2>
      <p>Arguably, the microflora that make up your large intestine are the most significant. It’s thought that the two to three kilos of bacteria that reside in there can influence your mood, energy levels, immune system and just about every aspect of your overall wellbeing.</p>

      <h2>6. THE INTESTINAL MICROFLORA CAN BE IMPROVED BY THE INGESTION OF PROBIOTICS LIKE ACTIVIA.</h2>
      <p>Probiotics are the ‘friendly’ microorganisms (either bacteria or yeast) that help keep a balance of healthy microflora in your gut. Probiotics can be found in foods such as milk and yogurt and are also available in supplement form. Pure by Activia yogurt has been specially formulated to contain an exclusive probiotic culture called Bifidus Regularis®, which is proven to help reduce digestive discomfort.</p>

      <h2>8. WHAT ABOUT PREBIOTICS?</h2>
      <p>Prebiotics are the fibres found in many plant foods that help friendly bacteria thrive in your gut – in other words they help sustain the probiotics. They occur naturally in foods such as leeks, asparagus, chicor, Jerusalem artichokes, garlic, onions, wheat and oats. Both probiotics and prebiotics play an important role in your digestive health.</p>
