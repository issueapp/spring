You’ve no doubt noticed a surge of words like kimchi, koji and kombucha sprouting up across more and more café menus. Fermented foods aren’t just a fad though; cultures around the world have been eating them for centuries - from sauerkraut in Germany to kimchi in Korea. There’s good reason for it too, as these funky fodders are great for a healthy gut.

The lactofermentation process allows natural bacteria to feed on the sugar and starch in the food, creating lactic acid, beneficial enzymes, b-vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids and various strains of probiotics. These nutrients restore the proper balance of bacteria in the gut that are otherwise diminished from years of taking antibiotic drugs and drinking chlorine-laced water. The live bacteria contained in fermented foods also breaks down the food to a more digestible form, helping your insides to stay calm and run more smoothly.

Incorporating more fermented foods in your diet is really easy. You can even have a try at the fermentation process at home. A basic sauerkraut recipe can be made using three simple ingredients - cabbage, water and salt. Kombucha and water kefir are also inexpensive to make and can even be carbonated to make a refreshing soda.”
