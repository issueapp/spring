Accelerators didn’t exist before Y-Combinator was founded in Silicon Valley in 2005 but now they are in most cities. They each have slightly different ingredients in their recipe but the common elements are:

The startups already exist before the program in some form. ‘Incubators’ like Pollenizer in contrast create something from nothing.
The program is a fixed duration. 3-6 months.
The program is heavily mentor driven. The main value comes from the connections and opportunities that the accelerator ‘family’ brings.
A small seed investment is made for equity

The best accelerators are very competitive to get into. In Australia, Telstra’s accelerator gets about 300 applications per batch, from which 10 are chosen. If you are applying for Angelpad, you will be up against 2000, for 12 spots, likewise, Techstars will receive 1500 applicants for just 10 places. 

You need to:

- Decide if there is a good fit between your startup and an accelerator
- Then hustle hustle hustle to get in. That’s what others will be doing.

## Is there a good fit?

First you should figure out if the accelerator and you are a good match. Don’t think about the accelerator exclusively as a source of capital. You will need to pay with a percentage of equity and you will need to dedicate a lot of time and effort to the program. This is all a waste if the fit is bad. Are you right? Is the accelerator right?


### Are you ready to be accelerated?

There is a sweet spot for joining an accelerator. Simply point, the startup is ready for acceleration and NEEDS acceleration.  If you are already growing very well, why go into an accelerator? If you are still wireframing your ide or doing very early customer development work, you will find that the accelerator program races by before you get a chance to extract real value.  

### Do your due diligence

Not all accelerators are created equally. Do your research into your accelerator of choice.

- How many graduating companies raise capital?
- How many graduating companies are still around a couple of years later.
- Go and meet graduated founders and ask them what it was like?
- Who are the mentors? Can they help you?

This information can be hard to find but some accelerators like Y-Combinator, share their performance.

If the fit looks good between you and the accelerator, let’s start hustling.

## Application Hacks

### Product or Business?

Do you understand your business model or are you 100% focused on making a kick-ass product. Accelerators want to know that you have a business model. Think through your business as a lean canvas and be ready to describe it as a business model.

In the application process you will be required to describe it in detail on the forms and also in pitches. 

Never forget that the accelerator is, in the end, an investor. They want to see something that might 10x or more their investment.

### Unique value

Are you unique? What other startups do you sound like? Imagine the decision makers scrolling through hundreds of applications, frequently with multiple ‘variations on a theme’. What is it about your application that makes them pay attention?  

### Traction

It is all about traction. Always. How do you communicate your business so that outsiders understand that this train is rolling and there is no stopping it. What have you done? What are you doing now? What’s next? How quickly are your engagement numbers showing that users love your product? Do you have sales? Are they growing?

### Show execution (I can be accelerated)

Related to traction. Accelerators want to be great at accelerating the growth of startups. Show them that you are an executor and, with their help, you will be a machine.

### Meet mentors

Learn who the mentors in the program are and try to meet at least one. Learn what is important to them. What do they think is a sign of a strong startup? Try to get a feel for the personality of the program and how you can present in that frame. Often mentors are also part of the decision making process about who gets in. So lobby them because others will.

### and lastly.. Hustle ! 

It can all be in the Hustle, as US based startup, Vugle worked out, when applying to the Angelpad incubator set up by ex-Googler’s. Vungle’s co-founder, used unconventional techniques to get themselves noticed in the most notorious hack, read about it here. 


### Good luck

The best accelerators have it down to a science. If you find a good fit, you will get the maximum possible growth and development of your startup in a short amount of time. Good luck. Now start hustling.
