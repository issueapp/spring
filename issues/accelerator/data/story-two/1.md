Accelerators have slightly different ingredients in their recipe but the common elements are:

The startups already exist before the program in some form. ‘Incubators’ like Pollenizer in contrast create something from nothing.
The program is a fixed duration. 3-6 months.
The program is heavily mentor driven. The main value comes from the connections and opportunities that the accelerator ‘family’ brings.
A small seed investment is made for equity

The best accelerators are very competitive to get into. In Australia, Telstra’s accelerator gets about 300 applications per batch, from which 10 are chosen. If you are applying for Angelpad, you will be up against <a href="http://vator.tv/news/2012-11-29-angelpads-5th-demo-day-presents-12-promising-startups">2000, for 12 spots</a>, likewise, Techstars will receive 1500 applicants for just 10 places.

You need to:

- Decide if there is a good fit between your startup and an accelerator
- Then hustle hustle hustle to get in. That’s what others will be doing.

## Is there a good fit?

First you should figure out if the accelerator and you are a good match. Don’t think about the accelerator exclusively as a source of capital. You will need to pay with a percentage of equity and you will need to dedicate a lot of time and effort to the program. This is all a waste if the fit is bad. Are you right? Is the accelerator right?


### Are you ready to be accelerated?

There is a sweet spot for joining an accelerator. Simply point, the startup is ready for acceleration and NEEDS acceleration.  If you are already growing very well, why go into an accelerator? If you are still wireframing your idea or doing very early customer development work, you will find that the accelerator program races by before you get a chance to extract real value.

### Do your due diligence

Not all accelerators are created equally. Do your research into your accelerator of choice.

- How many graduating companies raise capital?
- How many graduating companies are still around a couple of years later.
- Go and meet graduated founders and ask them what it was like?
- Who are the mentors? Can they help you?

This information can be hard to find but some accelerators like Y-Combinator, share their performance.

If the fit looks good between you and the accelerator, let’s start hustling.
