### Product or Business?

Do you understand your business model or are you 100% focused on making a kick-ass product. Accelerators want to know that you have a business model. Think through your business as a <a href="http://pollenizer.com/a-quick-walkthrough-lean-dashboard-v4">lean canvas</a> and be ready to describe it as a business model.

In the application process you will be required to describe it in detail on the forms and also in pitches.

Never forget that the accelerator is, in the end, an investor. They want to see something that might 10x or more their investment.

### Unique value

Are you unique? What other startups do you sound like? Imagine the decision makers scrolling through hundreds of applications, frequently with multiple ‘variations on a theme’. What is it about your application that makes them pay attention?

### Traction

It is all about traction. Always. How do you communicate your business so that outsiders understand that this train is rolling and there is no stopping it. What have you done? What are you doing now? What’s next? How quickly are your engagement numbers showing that users love your product? Do you have sales? Are they growing?

### Show execution (I can be accelerated)

Related to traction. Accelerators want to be great at accelerating the growth of startups. Show them that you are an executor and, with their help, you will be a machine.

### Meet mentors

Learn who the mentors in the program are and try to meet at least one. Learn what is important to them. What do they think is a sign of a strong startup? Try to get a feel for the personality of the program and how you can present in that frame. Often mentors are also part of the decision making process about who gets in. So lobby them because others will.

### and lastly.. Hustle !

It can all be in the Hustle, as US based startup, Vugle worked out, when applying to the Angelpad incubator set up by ex-Googler’s. Vungle’s co-founder, used unconventional techniques to get themselves noticed in the most notorious hack, <a href="http://pando.com/2012/05/02/vungles-co-founders-hustle-their-way-to-a-2-million-seed-round/">read about it here</a>.


### Good luck

The best accelerators have it down to a science. If you find a good fit, you will get the maximum possible growth and development of your startup in a short amount of time. Good luck. Now start hustling.
