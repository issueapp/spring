If you build a product and then think about marketing, you’re doing it wrong. Or, as Patrick Vlaskovitz from Superpowered puts it, “how your people learn about your product is part of your product.” And to drive the point home, Reid Hoffman’s take is: “If you are making a networked product, then you must know what your strategy is for being found.”

And if you’re still unconvinced:

Marketing in startups is often thought of as “other”, something you think about after the real work of validating and building your product is finished. Perhaps, something you can leave outsiders (third party publicists) to take care of?

> Marketing has to be an integral part of your startup from the very beginning.

If not, you’re missing out on a number of important opportunities for customer discovery, as well as a chance to better understand what your product market/fit is. At the end of the day that is what customer development is. Here are three compelling reasons to think of marketing AS customer development:

### 1) Early market testing around messaging leads you to understand what your customers are looking for

One of the first things that startups can do to validate an idea (before any code is written) is run a number of ads with different messages to see which is clicked on/interacted with the most. This means you can drill down to what exactly your customers are wanting. Often we set up ads at launch, only to discover that what interests people is not what you are really offering. It’s much harder to change a product than it is an ad. Use marketing from day one to understand what your customers are looking for.

TIP: I’ve worked on a number of startups where we used Facebook ads to look at the demographics (FB reports these) of the people that click on the ads. In at least two startups the audience we thought we were attracting was not the one who showed interest. In one case, we identified our target audience as female, household decision makers to find that the demographic was in fact young, single males.

### 2) Opportunities and thinking around for product discovery need to be made from day one

How are people going to hear about your product? Think about this from the very beginning and let it inform the product you build. An example of this sort of thinking is to limit beta releases to users who are invited by friends. People are likely to use products that their friends are using, particularly if it has a social element. If new user’s friends are there, then you’re someway to solving that problem.

CASE STUDY: Tupperware are considered the original pioneers on this by creating Tupperware parties. Until then, they were flogging pretty much the same thing as everything else. Their Tupperware parties became part of the product (if not THE product).

### 3) Understanding and retelling the company story to your customers is as important as pitching to your investors

Marketing is a lot like pitching, only the “investor” is your customer. Understanding your company story and being able to communicate that to people is an essential part of any successful startup. When you use external PR, the connection between you and that story can become distorted. Get advice, but try and hone those skills internally. Nobody but you will be more compelling when it comes to the story of the thing that you passionately believe in. If you can pitch an investor, you can learn to relate and engage your customers.

TIP: In the early days especially, it is important not to lose any company learnings by engaging third parties to run marketing or advertising campaigns. Keep the sharing tight between the team and don’t be tempted to outsource what is essentially a channel to your early customers (and discovering product/market fit). If you can pitch a startup idea, you can market an early one too.

Don’t shy away from learning about marketing. It’s an integral part of any startup. Without it you could have the greatest startup that nobodies ever heard of. It happens. A lot.
