I spent yesterday afternoon at Muru-D where the final 22 companies are battling it out for 10 spots in the first intake of Telstra’s new accelerator. I worked with two startups throughout the course of the afternoon, helping them tighten their pitches. Here are some themes that emerged.

### 1. Look people in the eye. Breath. You know this shit

No matter how nervous you are, stop. Take a breath. Look around the room at your audience. Smile. Look them in the eye. Get to know them. If you don’t, you will start speaking at the same rate that your heart is beating and your audience will not be able to keep up. Set the rhythm for what happens next. You are about to share how amazing your company is. There is nothing to be nervous about because your company IS amazing.

Hack 1: One thing that works for me is to say “That’s amazing isn’t it!?” in my head when I have made an important point. It slows me down and gives the audience a chance to take it in. It’s easy to feel like you are boring people if you pause or speak too slow. The inverse it true, you bore them when you speak too fast and they are experiencing a talking body which doesn’t appear to care whether they understand.

###  2. More != more

More content does not make a more impressive pitch. The problem I describe in 1 is made worse when you put too much in your pitch and you feel like you need to cover it all in 5 minutes (which is how long you will get in most cases). If you do that, you have set yourself up for fail. You will not tell a full story and likely not manage to leave the audience with an impression of value for your startup. This problem tends to happen most to the cleverest product and engineering entrepreneurs who try to describe every detail of the product.

Hack 2: To practice, we use our universal pitch deck as a starting point and try to get through the whole thing very quickly by setting the presentation to change slides automatically every 6.5 seconds. This forces us to get the key points out simply and completely as well as showing us what real fear from limited time feels like. Do this, and you easily get through everything you need to in 5 minutes and nothing will feel too short ever again.

Hack 3: Use a ‘Gaddy Pitch’ to explain your startup without the BS. Here’s the pattern: “You know how… well what we do is… In fact…” This is how you explain your startup to your Mum and everyone needs to have that base understanding of value.

> Canva: You know how everyone has a blog or Facebook page these days and needs images to stand out from the crowd and get better engagement. Well, what we do is, create a dead simple too for anyone to make a gorgeous original image online in just a few minutes for next to no money. In fact, we are only a few months old and we already have a few thousand people using Canva all over the world.

Get the idea? Do you communicate this in your bigger pitch? Make sure the value proposition of your startup is crystal clear, there is always time in the Q&A and follow-up meetings for your to answer complex questions in detail and demonstrate how much you know what you are doing.

###  4. What is the riskiest thing about YOUR startup?

Our chairman Tony Faure has a gift for the ultra-clarifying framing question. Here is one he asks all the time: “For investors to invest, what do they have to believe?” Sometimes there might be doubt that there is a real problem to solve in which the startup needs to show how much pain people have. Sometimes there might concerns that the startup is entering a customer context that is controlled by other people who may fight to keep that startup out. Schools for example, or health. In this case the startup needs to convince the audience that there is a strategy to route around them. Yesterday I heard a pitch from a company that was solving a huge problem. A problem that is so huge that I have heard about 20 pitches in the last year for similar businesses. The reason the problem isn’t solved is that it is bloody hard to do so. So all of the 20 pitches I have heard are for businesses that will fail. This company needs to leave us with the thought that they have found a way.

Hack 4: Share your pitch as often as you can with people that know the space and ask for feedback from them on what feels like the riskiest part of the business. You will quickly establish a pattern and refine the pitch to tell investors what they need to believe.

Generally, I am distrusting pitches more and more. A great pitch does not mean that the business is also great and accelerators all over the world are spewing out awesome pitches for crappy businesses.

But you still need to be good at it.
