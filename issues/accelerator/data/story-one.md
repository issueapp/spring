## YouTube


In the very early days of Facebook, when it had fewer than 15 employees,  there was an employee called Steve Chen who decided  that, after working there for only a few weeks, it just wasn’t for him. Like a lot of talented people, he just wanted to do his own thing and has an idea for a  video startup.

Matt Cohler, who had hired him, tried to convince him that it was a bad idea, telling him that facebook was going to be huge, and that there were already many video startups around.

Chen wasn’t convinced. He left to start a company called YouTube.

## Angry Birds


In 2003 some Finnish guys decided to convert their love for making games into a video games company. Their plan was to make one game after another in the hope that one of them would catch on.

51 games and 6 years later, they were still at it. Their 52nd game was a slingshot game involving birds.

Today, they have over a billion users, 500 employees and partnerships with some of the world’s most recognizable names like Star Wars, NASA and the Chinese government.

> TAKEAWAY: It can take 51 failures to become a success.

## Lego

During the Great Depression, **Ole Kirk Christiansen**, a carpenter in a small rural town started making wooden toys as a side business.

Then, after WWII, he took a big gamble and invested most of his company’s cash into buying a plastic injection moulding machine. Its first plastic toy was a truck that could be taken apart and rebuilt.

At the time plastic toys were seen as cheap and low-quality, and many of his customers suggested he continue to concentrate on his high-quality, very popular wooden or metal toys.

But he took the plunge and invested in plastics all the same.  Over the next 10 or so years, the company made more and more plastic toys.  A fire in the factory saw most of their wooden products destroyed and they took the plunge and went ahead with all-plastic lego bricks.

## Pinterest


There are many great pivot stories (Flickr and eBay some of the more well known), but it’s a trait common to more startups than not.

CEO Ben Silberman abandoned his long held plans to become a doctor and founded Pinterest during the recession.

Before Pinterest became social media’s fastest growing website, and landed on the cover of Fast Company, CEO Ben Silbermann set out to transform every cell phone into a clothing retail outlet with an app called Tote. He didn’t succeed.

> TAKEAWAY: Pivot is not a dirty word.

## Airbnb


Shortly after moving to San Francisco in October of 2007, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia created the initial concept for AirBed & Breakfast during the Industrial Design Conference held by Industrial Designers Society of America.

The original site offered short-term living quarters, breakfast and a unique business networking opportunity for attendees who were unable to book a hotel in the saturated market.

At the time, roommates Chesky and Gebbia could not afford the rent for their loft in San Francisco. They made their living room into a bed and breakfast, accommodating three guests on air mattresses and providing homemade breakfast.

The site, “airbedandbreakfast.com” was officially launched on August 11, 2008.

To help fund the site, the founders created special edition breakfast cereals, with candidates Barack Obama and John McCain as the inspiration for “Obama O’s” and “Cap’n McCains”. In two months, 800 boxes of cereal were sold for $40, which generated more than $30,000 for the company’s incubation and attracting Y Combinator’s Paul Graham.

> TAKEAWAY: Think outside the (cereal) box.

## Pandora

What makes the Pandora story so compelling is not the enormous growth that the internet music streaming has had, but the depths of financial despair that it rose from.  At his most desperate, Founder Tim Westergren, had maxed out credit cards, had $500,000 of personal debt and was being sued by some of his former employees

It took 350 pitches to investors before Pandora got its first investment.  Westergren used about $2 million of that initial investment to pay back his employees, who had all been working for free until then.

In September last year, the company filed a prospectus to raise $230.8 million dollars through the sale of 10 million shares at a price of $23.99 per share. The offering dwarfed its $90 million IPO in 2011 by a factor of three.
