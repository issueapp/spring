<a href="http://pollenizer.com">Pollenizer</a> is Australia’s first early stage tech incubator founded in 2008. We incubate our own companies, while designing incubator and accelerator programs for partners in Asia Pacific. 

We’ve put together this Accelerator handbook to help you get the edge when you apply to top accelerator programs and to build confidence when communicating your business for investment.

We’re excited to take you on a journey that could get your startup on the road to success.
