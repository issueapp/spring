OK, so we all know about **AARRR**; the most important acronym in the apparently-less-different-than-once-thought worlds of both pirates and startups.

Now I want to step you through five of the most brilliant customer development hacks that (IMHO, at least) were vital to the eventual success of five startups we have since gone on to become household names… Let’s learn from the best and see how they worked their way through the funnel – from acquiring eyeballs in the first place, to activation, through retention and referral, and ultimately to what we are all shooting for – revenue!

## Acquisition

Two-sided marketplaces are hard. Reeeeeally hard. It is a chicken-and-egg proposition, trying to bring both sides of a market together at once, but Air BnB did a superb job of overcoming this oft-terminal challenge.

> “How did they do it?”, you ask… They faked it until the made it!

Rather than having to acquire a bunch of travellers’ eyeballs and hosts’ eyeballs at the same time, they focused on one side of the market, went to where they knew a treasure trove of properties were already being listed and *ahem* started spamming.

Dave Gooden’s post on how Air BnB became a billion dollar company is brilliant. Let’s just say it all started with a mountain of Gmail accounts, an unknown number of sales people who were contracted to (but not employees of) the company, and a lot of copy’n’pasting!

## Activation

I know, I know… I said we would look at five superstar startups as we work our way through the five stages of the AARRR funnel, but I’m going to cheat and use Air BnB again here.

So, they attracted lots of potential hosts to their site by hacking Craigslist. Now, how did they activate those leads and get them doing something which requires a whole lot more effort than an ugly text-only Craigslist advert?

They gave out free professional photography to spruce up listings.

Not only did this remove a major barrier which was preventing potential hosts completing their listing, the stylish images gave prospective guests a sense of what they were in for and helped them trust (complete with “verified” ribbon) what was at that stage a completely new approach to short-stay accommodation.

Sure there was a cost to this, but as an added benefit for Air BnB, when users could see the professionally photographed listings attracting more bookings, it increased the incentive for other hosts to spend a bit more time on their own listing – after all, this is a marketplace and everyone is competing for the next booking!

## Retention

I know I am going to regret this, but do you remember the Facebook *poke* …?

Was it a harmless whim? Perhaps a developer’s joke that went too far? Whatever the case, I put it to you that the Poke was one of many retention initiatives that drove user engagement in Facebook’s early days.

Go on, admit it… Each time you logged in to Facebook your eyes scanned to that right-hand column to see who had poked you since your last visit. You returned the favour, which triggered an email notification in their inbox, which brought them back to Facebook, where they poked you back, which triggered an email notification in your inbox, which brought you back to Facebook… You get the drift.

[Side Note: Apparently Twitter has a retention problem, with a mere 11% of Twitter's new users from 2012 still tweeting. Have you noticed any new retention initiatives they are experimenting with? If you are like me and find yourself tweeting less and less, what is Twitter doing to try bring you back into their platform?]

## Referral

Put your hands up if you use Dropbox… Everyone?

Right, now keep your hands up if you were referred to Dropbox by a friend in the first place, and/or have gone on to refer Dropbox to other people (and earned yourself some free space in the process)… Still everyone?!

<img data-media-id="images:3">


If I was to describe what Dropbox does in four words, it would be “document management and collaboration”. And it is that second element – collaboration between multiple authors of the same document – which drives so much of Dropbox’s customer acquisition strategy.

I don’t know this for a fact, but I would be very surprised if Drew Houston and his cloud boffins haven’t run the numbers and worked out that it is more much efficient (read “cheaper”) for them to provide an extra 500MB for every new customer that you refer, rather than pay for a bunch of ads and try to drag new users into the top of their funnel the old-fashioned way.

When your product is that sticky, and referral is baked into its very existence, Dropbox is obviously pretty confident that enough of us are eventually going to move all the way through the funnel and become paying customers… If it costs them a few (thousand) extra servers here and there to bring more collaborators into the top of the funnel (and make the product even stickier in the process) then so be it!

## Revenue

Don’t tell anyone, but the catalyst for this whole post was a discussion we had at Pollenizer the other day about our new favourite communications tool. For those who haven’t heard of it, Slack “brings all your communication together in one place. It’s real-time messaging, archiving and search for modern teams”.

Since we first trialled it a few months ago, Slack’s “freemium” service has completely revolutionised the way we communicate - our inboxes will never be the same again! Well, at least they will never be the same again now, after we have upgraded to a paid plan.

“How did Slack bump you tight arses up to a paid account?” you ask…

<img data-media-id="images:4">

Search.

When it comes to functionality, Slack is awesome. But from a business model perspective, search is their killer feature.

Seriously, the product is so darn addictive that you can hardly imagine life without it except when you cross the magical 10,000 message barrier you lose access to your old archives. And, because the product is so good, when you have completely changed your behaviour and reduced emails by a factor of 10, it isn’t that hard to ask people to pay for the privilege of a fully searchable archive.

So, there you have it. Five customer development hacks from your favourite startups.
