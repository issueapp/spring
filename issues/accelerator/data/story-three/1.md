### What should people consider before they submit their business to an accelerator program?

Make sure you’ve done your homework, all accelerator programs have some mandatory requirements, make sure you’re happy to sign up to them!
For example, at muru-D we need the co-founders to commit to working on their idea full-time to move to Sydney for the 6 months of the program. There’s plenty of choice out there for startups now which is fantastic, so its important to choose the right program for your startup.

### How do you usually choose your startups?

The main thing we look at is the team. Is it a balanced team with the right skills and experience to build the startup, do they have traction already?

This doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to have launched already or have paying customers (although that’s always nice!), but some sort of demonstrable progress momentum is key. Have you talked to potential customers, have you validated that you really are fixing a problem or filling a market need?

Also, I’m looking for bucket loads of passion in the co-founding team. I want to know that they are all fully committed and will move mountains to make their business work and, that they won’t give up.

### What type of companies would you like to see participate in an upcoming program?

As long as the startup is digital and can scale to multiple markets then I’m interested in seeing their application.  I’m really pleased that in our first intake we have a pretty much 50:50 split of B2B & B2C startups, that we cover lots of different industry categories, that we even have a hardware startup too.
One other thing I’m really proud of is that 4 of our final 10 have a female co-founder or CEO.  I definitely want to see more of that!

### At what stage in a company’s life should they apply for an accelerator?

Obviously we invest in fairly early stage businesses, so we’re looking at startups that are usually less than 2 years old or have raised less than $250k of external funding (not including friends or family investment).
If your idea is super super early stage, we’d still consider it, but we do like to invest in teams that are formed and that there is a demo of the startup already in place (even if this is a mock-up).

### Do you have any conditions on similar types of companies entering the program?

We don’t have conditions that all startups need to be different. However if there are 2 or 3 startups doing exactly the same thing then it’s likely we’d invest in the best of the bunch.

My coaching here to startups who are in a really competitive space would be, make sure you can prove exactly what your USP is versus everyone else’s. If you can prove it, maybe it’s time to look at pivoting or doing something different.
