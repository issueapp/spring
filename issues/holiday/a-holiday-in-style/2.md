“The white-on-white trend has spread like wildfire and it’s one of my favourite styling tips. It’s an easy way to create an effortless, classic look that is still polished and modern. I love classics with a twist - like these quilted, high-waisted shorts - that refresh your wardrobe and keep it modern.”
