> The white-on-white trend has spread like wildfire and its one of my favourite styling tips. Itâ€™s an easy way to create an effortless, classic look that is still polished and modern. I love classics with a twist - like these quilted, high-waisted shorts - that refresh your wardrobe and keep it modern.
