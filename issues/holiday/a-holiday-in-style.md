She is on a summer escape, straying from the crowd in search for freedom and peace. She has an unquenchable desire to explore her surroundings, while collecting beautiful keepsakes along the way, from seashells to flowers to photographs of locals.

Her style is a reflection of her allure: timeless and minimal. Under the summer sun she opts for crisp whites and loose fits - breezy, stylish ideas to keep her cool in the heat whilst keeping to her effortlessly chic persona.
