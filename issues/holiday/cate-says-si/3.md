Si emanates a soft yet sultry feel to any women who wish to try it. It’s chypre scent fused with a burst of cassis nectar and enriched with two types of sensual vanilla, allures ones senses, while the light musky wood lingers subtly on the skin. Enhanced by blends of freesia, patchouli and blond amber wood, this fragrance brings forward the shades of the independent feminine woman.

The character of the Si woman is mimicked through the design aesthetic of the glass flacon, playing on the duality between strength and lightness. The Si bottle is simultaneously structured and simple. With its form being neither sharply squared nor spherical, its natural elegance makes it a timeless piece for any woman’s dressing  table.
