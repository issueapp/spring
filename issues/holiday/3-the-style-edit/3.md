Faux leather pleated skirt (Maison Martin Margiela):

“The right statement piece, like this pleated faux leather skirt, can transform a simple outfit from day to night. Alternatively, you can soften this look by replacing the black camisole with an off-white one or dress it up with a plunging back top and diamond drop earrings.”

-- Jysla Kay

“The silk camisole. With thin spaghetti straps and a breathable flowy shape, the silk cami is a wardrobe must. It’s minimal, it’s sexy and it’s an extremely versatile piece that often gets overlooked for its simplicity.”

-- Aubrey from TheLoveAssembly
