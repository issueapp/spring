Icebergs Terrace Cafe, 1 Notts Avenue, Bondi Beach

The best views of Bondi can be seen with the return of the Terrace Cafe at Icebergs’ balcony, and this time they’re staying for good! It only fits 20 people and has a selection of light and fresh food but we suggest starting your day with an early morning swim or walk along the coast and pop in to pick up a fresh breakfast smoothie or juice, while you enjoy the multi million dollar view with your own eyes.

For a great local feel head to Bondi Picnic, 101 Hall Street, Bondi Beach

Friendly owners, locally sourced produce and one tasty menu make Bondi Picnic a favourite among the locals. A great spot to sit in the sun drenched table out the front and people watch over an early breakfast or your morning coffee. Order their avocado on toast - it’s an Aussie favourite with a combination of vegemite, avocado and lemon on multigrain sourdough (poached eggs optional) and their delicious banana smoothie!
