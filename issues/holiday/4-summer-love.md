When it comes to love and travel, the Italian Riviera proudly wears its heart on its sleeve. Its romantic seascape is all fairy floss skies, sherbet-coloured fishing villages, and ombre blue seasides that cast an intoxicating spell over summer lovers and seasoned sightseers. For an idyllic summer escape, I also look no further than my hometown of Perth, Western Australia. With arguably some of the most picturesque beaches in the world, its unassuming beauty and breathtaking sunsets is why I will always call this place home.
