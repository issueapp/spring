Blue skies and balmy summer nights, summer in Sydney is definitely one to be spent soaking up the sun and being carefree! My favourite summer day with a group of friends  is spent on a road trip up north towards my coastal escape, but staying local is proven to be just as great! Spend a day in Bondi venturing out to great cafes, shops and bars with our most popular beach right at your doorstep or, escape the crowds with a loved one and head for something a little more serene like Wattamolla Beach, secluded and surrounded by Australian bush. There’s always something a little different to explore while you’re in Sydney!
