      "<p>Lunch at Pizzeria La Smorfia (Via Vittorio Emanuele, 73, 19016, Monterosso). Arguably the best pizzeria in Monterosso. The Quattro Formaggi and the Margherita are standouts - and be sure to chase them down with the house wine for a mouthwatering meal that will set you back only 9 euros.</p>

      <p>Dinner at Marina Piccola (Via Lo Scalo, 16, 19010 Manarola). Grab a table here and enjoy a glass of the Cinque Terre sciacchetr√† as the sun sets over the Mediterranean Sea.</p>"
