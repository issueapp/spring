Now it wouldn’t be fair to reference picnics without acknowledging Melbourne, The Garden City of Australia and its famous Fitzroy Gardens. The major Victorian era landscaped gardens present a myriad of activity areas, fun for the whole family:

- An ornamental lake
- Kiosk and cafe
- Conservatory
- Cooks' Cottage - a house where the parents of James Cook lived. (the cottage was in England at that time).
- Sinclair’s Cottage
- Model Tudor village
- Fountains and sculptures
- Band Pavilion
- The Rotunda
- The fairies’ tree
