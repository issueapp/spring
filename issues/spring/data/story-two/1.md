I love the  liveliness that fresh flowers can bring to a space, especially in Spring when you can pick them from your own garden! My past preference has always steered towards a tall and majestic flower arrangement. With that being said, it is an impractical choice for casual dining or as a coffee table centerpiece. As much as we all love fresh Spring flowers, we don’t want to peer through the flowers to see each other across the table and television shows right?

I started to look around for a short vase. Surprisingly, it is not easy to find an affordable and decorative short vase! (And I don’t want the clear glass ones). Talk about not finding something when you are looking.

Then I came across these rounded candle holders at a discount store.  I love the blush and neutral colour palettes and its reflective surface is a bonus too! Since the candles holders are made of glass, there is no reason that they can’t double as vases. They are a perfect for small arrangements with flowers from your garden.
