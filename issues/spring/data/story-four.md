Day to day I can be somewhat conservative when it comes to dinnerware. However, as the sun starts to shine I like to keep a look out for some bright and colourful touches to add to my dinner table. Recently I’ve fallen in love with Turkish inspired pieces - I can’t help but fall in love with the vibrancy of colours and exotic patterns! These beautiful pieces will be making their way out this Spring!

2. Set of 6 Turkish Glasses Clear Window ($36)
3. Copper mug ($36)
4. Cup and saucer “Turkish Delight Sky” ($20)
5. Mosaic Flower Coaster ($11.95)
6. And a matching mosaic flower placemat ($17.95)
7. Le Souk Ceramique – Tabarka Pitcher ($23)
