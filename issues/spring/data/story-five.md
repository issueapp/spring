It’s not difficult to pick up that I love making meatballs and grilled them. Well today, my mince chicken has gone through the similar treatment: Thai style, meatballs and grilled. But this time I’ve coupled these tasty meatballs with rice noodle salad.

This salad has lots of flavours: the crowd pleasing sweet chilli sauce, the tanginess from the white vinegar, the aromatic and very mildly bitter fresh lemongrass (yes you can eat lemongrass raw), coupled with rice noodles (vermicelli) which naturally soak up the flavours around them, citrusy fresh coriander leaves and last but not least, Thai red curry spiced grilled chicken meatballs. I’ve also added paper thin (sliced using a vegetable peeler) cucumber and carrots to further enhance the colour and texture to the salad.

Needless to say, I am really into Thai style dishes lately. You can’t believe how much fresh coriander I have been keeping in my fridge. It’s crazy! I hope you’ll like this rice noodle salad recipe. Enjoy!
