Hello! Welcome to the second edition of Spread! The days are getting longer and the sun is shining which can only mean one thing – Spring is here! I love that the change in season doesn’t only affect the weather but also brings fresher, lighter food, plenty of fresh flowers and long lazy Sunday afternoons in the garden. I’ve put together some of my favourite recipes and tips to celebrate Spring!
