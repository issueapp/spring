I love the  liveliness that fresh flowers can bring to a space, especially in Spring when you can pick them from your own garden! My past preference has always steered towards a tall and majestic flower arrangement. With that being said, it is an impractical choice for casual dining or as a coffee table centerpiece. As much as we all love fresh Spring flowers, we donâ€™t want to peer through the flowers to see each other across the table and television shows right?
