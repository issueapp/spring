Being born and raised in Malaysia, I will always have a soft spot for tropical fruits. Melbourne has had a sunny start to Spring, which has made me reminisce of summer in Orange.

Personally, I am up for a tropical themed cheesecake at any occasion and season. But when the weather gets warmer I crave for a lighter and refreshing dessert. I love how the tang from passionfruit and pineapple mellows the richness of the cheesecake which makes an ideal dessert to cool off a warm backyard barbecue meal.  Furthermore, I love the colors they bring to the cheesecake, coupled with a drizzling of maple syrup, it feels like this cheesecake has been sun-kissed!

It took me a while to discover how to use almond meal to make a crust.  Seriously, it is so delicious and totally fits with my fuss free theme. I love the added nuttiness almond meal crust brings. In fact it is so delicious that I think I can eat the crust on its own!  I also love the convenience of not having to process biscuits, which makes the cheesecake gluten free, which also means that more people can enjoy this sweet, tart and summery dessert!

## Ingredients

Crust Ingredients:

- 2½ cups almond meal
- 125g unsalted butter, melted & cooled
- 3 tbsps brown sugar

Cheesecake Ingredients:

- 500g Philadelphia Cream Cheese, softened
- ½ cup caster sugar
- 2 eggs
- 2 tsps vanilla extract
- 85g passionfruit pulp (½ of 170g canned passionfruit pulp)

Caramelised PineappleTopping:

- 150g pineapple, diced
- ¼ cup maple syrup plus extra for final drizzling
- 85g passionfruit pulp (remaining ½ of 170g canned passionfruit pulp)

## Instructions

Crust:

- Preheat oven to 180°C for convection oven or 160°C for fan force oven. Line the bottom of a 20cm springform pan with baking paper and grease the side of the pan with melted butter. Set aside.
- Add almond meal, butter and brown sugar. Mix until well combined.
- Press the almond meal crumbs over base and the side of the prepared pan.
- Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes or until lightly golden brown. Set aside to cool.

Cheesecake:

- Preheat oven to 160°C for convection oven or 140°C for fan force oven.
- In a large mixing bowl, cream Philadelphia Cream Cheese and caster with a handheld/stand mixer until light and fluffy.
- Add eggs, one at a time, and beat until well combined.
- Add vanilla extract and passionfruit pulp. Continue beating until all the ingredients are well combined.
- Transfer the cream cheese batter onto the cooled almond meal crust.
- Place the spring form pan on a flat cookie pan to avoid leakage. Bake the cheesecake on the bottom rack (this is to prevent the surface from cracking) for an hour, or until the surface of the cheesecake appears to be light golden brown.
- Transfer the cheesecake onto a plate to cool completely.
- Refrigerate the cheesecakes for at least 3 hours, until it is fully set.
- Caramelised Pineapple Topping:
- In a non-stick pan, add ¼ cup of maple syrup and cook over medium heat until it starts to bubble.
- Add pineapple and cook to reduce the maple syrup to a toffee like consistency. Transfer the caremelised pineapple onto a plate to cool.
- Meanwhile, add the remaining passionfruit onto the same pan and cook until jam consistency is achieved.

To Serve:

Add the cooled caramelised pineapple onto the cheesecake, followed by the passionfruit. Drizzle with more maple syrup if preferred and serve immediately.

Notes:

Please make allowance for at least 3 hours of refrigeration time before serving.
