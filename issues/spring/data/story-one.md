When the weather warms up I crave for a lighter and refreshing dessert. It took me a while to discover how to use almond meal to make a crust.  Seriously, it is so delicious and totally fits with my fuss free theme. Plus It's gluten free! I love the added nuttiness almond meal crust brings. Enjoy this sweet, tart and summery dessert!
