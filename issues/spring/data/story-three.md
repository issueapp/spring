This spring salad is a burst of flavours; the crowd pleasing sweet chilli sauce, the tanginess from the white vinegar, the aromatic and very mildly bitter fresh lemongrass (yes you can eat lemongrass raw), coupled with rice noodles (vermicelli), citrusy fresh coriander leaves and last but not least, Thai red curry spiced grilled chicken meatballs.
