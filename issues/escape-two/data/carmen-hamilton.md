### *How did you get started with The Chronicles of Her?*
After spending so much time reading other blogs, I decided to use some of that time to start my own. It started as a side project while I was studying and evolved from there.

### *How often do you post?*
Two to three times per week at the moment, but five would be ideal. I’m working on it!

### *Who was your greatest inspiration?*
If we’re talking in a career sense, I find Natalie Massenet of Net-a-Porter very inspiring. She had a vision, and she started that company out of a home office. To think she’s been able to build it into what it is today is really quite incredible.

On a style front, I couldn’t really name one person. It’s been the cumulative effect of way too many hours spent trawling street style blogs and magazines.

### *What does an average day look like?*
Every day is completely different. I could be in Melbourne for the races with Gucci or working from my home in Bondi writing content and resizing images. If you average out the two extremes, I guess you could say an average day would involve emails, writing content, uploading, Instagram, and then an event in the evening.

### *What three words sum up Sydney in summer for you?*
Sun, salty margaritas.

### *How would you describe Sydney style?*
Sydney style strikes a balance between polished and relaxed. It’s reflective of our lifestyle by the beach. We like to get dressed up but it’s never over the top. It’s a lot like the Australian personality… we don’t take ourselves too seriously.

### *Top 3 fashion tips for a night out by the harbour?*
Relaxed shapes are best by the water, crisp white always feels fresh in summer and a red lip can take you anywhere.
