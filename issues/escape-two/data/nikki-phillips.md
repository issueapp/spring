### *Who or what has been your greatest inspiration?
My parents are my greatest inspiration in both love and life. My dad is a hard worker and has been my mentor from the beginning.

### *What does an average day look like?
My days are never a structured routine, which I enjoy. My blog allows me to travel the world and shoot in the most incredible and exotic places. Whereas when I’m home, a day could be filming or shooting or traveling nationally hosting Style classes. With my job you can never get bored.

### *What was the best thing about starting your blog?
I’ve always loved writing and being creative with fashion. When I started my blog not only could I do both, but I also got a chance to share with others the crazy ins and outs of my roller-coaster life. The jobs I do and people I meet fascinate me, so I love sharing that with others.

### *Favourite secret Sydney spot?
For food it’s Bruce Leaves in Bondi. It does the most sensational fresh salads that are so flavorsome. For a place it’s Rose Bay Beach Flats, which is dog friendly so it’s where I spend most mornings with my dogs.

### *What three words sum up Sydney in summer for you?
Not, long, enough!

### *What can’t you live without?
My two dogs. Tygalilly (11 years old) and Lochie (10 months), both staffies and both rescued. They are my shadows and best buds.

### *How would you describe Sydney style?
We are so fortunate to have incredible designers here in Australia and I think we get style right. I love how everyone adapts trends for themselves and are creative with fashion.

### *Best fashion advice for having drinks by the Harbour?
Keep it casual, cocktail, chic. Fashion is all about being experimental and having fun. This kind of environment really lets you address that. Whether it’s a structured jumpsuit with flat sandals or a gelato-toned cocktail dress with heels, you will look the part.

### *First memory of the Sydney Opera House?
My first memory of the Sydney Opera House was sunset drinks followed by Madame Butterfly. I remember being completely blown away by its architecture and the vibrant buzz that surrounds this beautiful icon.
