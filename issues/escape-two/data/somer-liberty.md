### *What does an average day look like?*
In our world there’s no such thing. Some mornings it's cups of tea over fabric selection, planning new ranges, dreaming up new silhouettes, other days it's celebrities for big events and some days we are on two planes in different states selling our ranges. It’s all fun though, we love it!

### *What was the best thing about starting your label?*
Creating beautiful product that brings joy to a lot of people. We have women gushing over dresses, the perfect shirt, their comfiest pair of sandals. So much satisfaction in that.

### *Favourite secret Sydney spot?*
S: Wattamolla Beach in the Royal National Park.

L: Camp Cove Beach. It's my little hideaway perfect for swims, picnics and I’m even getting hitched there on the sand in a couple of months.

### *What food sums up Sydney in summer for you?*
S: Gelato, gelato, gelato!

L: Summer fruits. Watermelon, mango, passionfruit.

### *What can’t you live without?*
S: Good music is a must for everyday.

L: My fiancé.

### *Best fashion advice for having drinks by the Harbour?*
L: The harbour is so glamorous and beautiful - you have to dress to match.

### *What’s your first memory of the Sydney Opera House?*
S:  The last Bon Iver concert was so special and I love, love, love the ballet.

L: For Sydney Opera House, it’s seeing the dutch Orchestra play. For Opera Bar. . . my first dates with my now fiancé. We would meet there for Friday night bubbles, I couldn’t imagine a better view and we would have such a great time we’d always end up staying for dinner and making a night of it.

### *What would you do with your last $50?*
S: Buy my favourite person a cocktail and share a moment with them.

L: Two glasses of Laurent-Perrier Champagne please! At least that's money well spent on a glass of laughter.

### *How would you describe Sydney style?*
We both agree that Sydney is a very glamorous city - but relaxed. Beach locations are definitely more casual, but the city is where you can wear your best. We love that mix!

### *Funniest fashion moment?*
Having our pet, Galah Miguel, on our swimwear campaign shoot … he kept wanting to bite the models ear off and undo her bikini top. #Miguelthegalah
