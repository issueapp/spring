It’s been a fabulous first month down at the brand new Opera Bar, with the summer season well under way and plenty to look forward to over the coming weeks. As we ring in 2015, we’re delighted to present to you the second edition of our digital magazine ‘Escape the Ordinary: Part 2’.

Featuring interviews with award winning Australian butcher Anthony Puharich of Vic’s Meat, as well as Opera Bar Executive Chef Lena D’Onofrio, ‘Escape the Ordinary: Part 2’ takes you behind the scenes into the inner workings of Opera Bar. Find out more about our brand new Charcuterie Bar, and discover what it’s like to run one of Sydney’s busiest kitchens against the iconic backdrop of our city’s world famous Harbour.

We’ll also be introducing you to our talented Opera Bar ambassadors, bloggers Nikki Phillips (stylebyphillips.com) and Carmen Hamilton (thechroniclesofher.blogspot.com.au), and designer sister duo Somer and Liberty of Watson X Watson who talk us through their love for Sydney, and give us their top tips on achieving success.

You can’t beat Sydney in the summertime, and where better to enjoy the very best of what the city has to offer than at Opera Bar? We look forward to seeing you very soon.

Love, Opera Bar
