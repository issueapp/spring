When Leena D’Onofrio began working at Opera Bar a decade ago, the budding sous chef couldn’t believe the scale of the place. It was still in its infancy but the kitchen she walked into was turning out five or six thousand plates a week. Today, that number’s nearly tripled to over 15,000 plates a week.

“This is a beast,” laughs D’Onofrio, who is now the executive chef at Opera Bar,  “And I love to tame it! I thrive on the stress - it makes me feel younger. People think I’m crazy but I honestly love it, I love the challenge.”

In the early days, those challenges included small wallmounted deck ovens for the pre-made pizzas. “At some points you had timers going off every few seconds,” she says.

The redevelopment of Opera Bar means all that is a thing of the past. “We now make the pizzas to order,” she says, “We roll the dough, do the toppings and pop them into a proper pizza oven.”

While she’s grateful to see the back of the tiny wall ovens, it’s the ability to incorporate much more seasonal produce that really has D’Onofrio excited. “This new phase is totally different,” she says. “We’ve been stepping up consistently, but this is a whole new level. The menu is about whatever’s around me and in season. When we see beautiful produce, we’ll try to incorporate it, from cheeses to fresh heirloom carrots. I don’t like to source stuff from overseas, I’m a very, very firm believer in using Australian products and not overcomplicating that product.”

D’Onofrio, who has worked in kitchens since she was 18, has seen tastes change and evolve. She believes people these days are more willing to try new things. “It’s nice to push the boundaries,” she says. “We’ll always cater to everybody but having things like the Raw Bar where you can get six or eight different varieties of oysters, shucked to order at the bar, as well as raw seafood like scampi and kingfish sashimi, is just fantastic. The way of the future is having people see fresh products being done right in front of them.”

The twin elements of showcasing as well as sharing food were two important touchstones when D’Onofrio designed the menu. “People eat with their eyes first,” she says, “so being able to present the food beautifully like all the hanging meats in the chactuterie room that will be sliced fresh, is a big thing for me. And then there’s all the share plates that we’re seeing people go for.  There’s even a slow-roasted Moran’s Lamb shoulder that you can share between three or four for your Sunday lunch!”

The craziness of the new kitchen is a long way from the simple family photo D’Onofrio had at the top of the Sydney Opera House stairs when her parents first brought her here as a kid. But she counts herself lucky for the ringside seat she has had working at Opera Bar. “Seeing the place grow has been wonderful,” says D’Onofrio, “And even though I work here, I still bring friends in, on nights off. Especially on a breezy summer’s night with a few oysters, the scampi with native finger limes and some wine, prosciutto and cheese - what more could you ask for?”
