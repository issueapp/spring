Anthony started at Vic's Meat's as a driver, then packed meat and worked in the office before his dad gave him a knife and started teaching him the family craft. “For Dad, to go from from an abattoir to retail was a huge transition,” says Anthony, “No pun intended, they’re two different beasts. Now the success of  Victor Churchill has shone a huge spotlight on our pretty modest family. It’s been an amazing journey and ride.”

When they opened, it was also a watershed moment for the father and son.  The fitout cost close to $2 million and they were spending it in the teeth of the GFC. “Dad always backed me but he was too nervous to come in,” says Anthony, “then, two days before we opened, after 18 months of work, he dropped by. He’s a tough Eastern European but when he saw what we created it was the first time I’d seen him overwhelmed with emotion.”

For those willing to listen and learn, Anthony has developed an almost evangelical zeal for sharing his knowledge about meat. He and his father have worked tirelessly at sharing their passion for fine meats with an ever-growing audience. The charcuterie room at Opera Bar is just the next step on that journey.

“I’m a bit one-eyed,” he says “but to sit by the water on a beautiful summer’s day with a dozen Sydney rock oysters, a glass of wine and a plate of some beautiful cured meats, parfaits and terrines is perfection. Gone are the days where you just ate beer nuts and pretzels. Australians are getting a lot more sophisticated in their tastes and it’s great to see us appreciating the traditional and unique products that are made using time-honoured techniques.”

## Wine Pairing

The Jamon Iberico Bellota Serrano, 18 months aged matches perfectly with the 2014 Jauma Biggles Grenache from the McLaren Vale. It’s fresh and vibrant, light and spicy, perfect for this amazing cured meat.
