Anthony Puharich might be a fifth generation but following tradition had nothing to do with family pressure. Quite the opposite. His father, Victor, who arrived from Croatia as a teenager with little more than a change of clothes and handful of English, wanted his son to get, as Puharich says, “a better job”.

“It might not sound like a big deal,” says Anthony, who studied finance and economics and went off into merchant banking, “but I was the first one in the family to graduate from university and go to work in a suit and tie. Then, nine or ten months into it, even though I loved what I was doing, something didn’t feel right.”

The history in his bones was calling. Anthony knew that his father was extremely good at what he did and he saw an opportunity to combine their skills. After some convincing, Victor left the meatworks he’d been at for 25 years and in 1996 he and his sonopened Vic’s Meats in a humble shop on Oxford Street, Darlinghurst.

These days, Vic’s Meat’s boutique offshoot, Victor Churchill, is arguably the most famous butcher in Australia. It beat Hermés and Louis Vuitton to win the “Best in Retail” gong at the 2010 Interior Design, Best of Year Awards in New York, the first time an Australian company had been nominated, let alone won.They received a visit from Oprah Winfrey and now they’re bringing their award-winning wares to Opera Bar’s purpose-built charcuterie room. “I’m just so excited with the concept,” says Anthony. “I love the idea of a charcuterie bar with all the cured meats. And being European, it all comes back to my roots.”

Anthony started at Vic's Meat's as a driver, then packed meat and worked in the office before his dad gave him a knife and started teaching him the family craft. “For Dad, to go from from an abattoir to retail was a huge transition,” says Anthony, “No pun intended, they’re two different beasts. Now the success of  Victor Churchill has shone a huge spotlight on our pretty modest family. It’s been an amazing journey and ride.”

When they opened, it was also a watershed moment for the father and son.  The fitout cost close to $2 million and they were spending it in the teeth of the GFC. “Dad always backed me but he was too nervous to come in,” says Anthony, “then, two days before we opened, after 18 months of work, he dropped by. He’s a tough Eastern European but when he saw what we created it was the first time I’d seen him overwhelmed with emotion.”

For those willing to listen and learn, Anthony has developed an almost evangelical zeal for sharing his knowledge about meat. He and his father have worked tirelessly at sharing their passion for fine meats with an ever-growing audience. The charcuterie room at Opera Bar is just the next step on that journey.

“I’m a bit one-eyed,” he says “but to sit by the water on a beautiful summer’s day with a dozen Sydney rock oysters, a glass of wine and a plate of some beautiful cured meats, parfaits and terrines is perfection. Gone are the days where you just ate beer nuts and pretzels. Australians are getting a lot more sophisticated in their tastes and it’s great to see us appreciating the traditional and unique products that are made using time-honoured techniques.”
