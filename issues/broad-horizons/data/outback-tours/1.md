Opals in the dust
The milky opalescent stuff lying in shards in the dirt around Coober Pedy is ''potch'' - the matrix for opal and raison d'etre for this strange town. Yes, there are tourists here but the mining madness is authentic and palpable, ably assisted by Heath Robinson-esque opal-digging contraptions, hippie-trippy outlets, bizarre props from science-fiction movies left lying in the sun and the famous underground hotels and hostels (even rooms in the 4Â½-star Desert Cave are distinctly other-worldly). Just when you think it's really weird, go out to the opal fields (preferably on a tour), the Moon Plains and the paint-box Breakaways to see truly bizarre landscapes. The smaller town of Andamooka is where opals are strip-mined; it's more gritty, more intense and just as interesting. The great-great-grandson of composer Mendelssohn is a resident artist. No, really, it's true.

Arkaroola Ridgetop Tour
This is an iconic tour of iconic country, where you cling to an open-topped four-wheel-drive while it scales the red-rock battlements of the northern Flinders Ranges. The tour operates out of private Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary, a seventh heaven for wildlife lovers (trails lead through chasms to waterholes and yellow-footed rock wallabies), stargazers (the observatory and star chair are open for business under clarion skies) and eco-warriors. The resort is comfortable and caters to all budgets. Debates about whether uranium miners should extract local resources occasionally stir the restaurant-bar at night.

Traditional perspectives
Some of the secrets of this old, old country still reside with Aboriginal people of the region. Tour guide Haydyn Bromley is a Kaurna man leading 4WD adventures out of Adelaide into the outback, where he invites local elders to share their knowledge, their company and (quite often) their quiet humour. Bromley connects guests with the different levels of outback - the natural, the European/pastoral and the Aboriginal - and few stones are left unturned. Reg Dodd is an Arabunna elder who was born at the southern end of Lake Eyre; he's been running tours of the region since 1996. You see sand, salt and stones? Now see what he sees.

Pop Quorn
The township of Quorn makes for a top long-weekend escape. It's a charming old-world railway town that offers great heritage, dry-country upland scenery and real outback flavour. The Austral pub is a hub; so, too, the Quandong Cafe. The owner of Quornucopia Gallery keeps his own hours; don't be surprised to see him open when you leave the pub. Bushwalking is particularly good, with walking trails to Warren Gorge and scenic drives to Devil's Peak, Mount Brown Conservation Park and Pichi Richi Pass. The bushwalk up to Devil's Peak is steep but reveals native vegetation, wildflowers, birds and fantastic panoramic views from the 670-metre summit.

Do it differently
Two- or four-day Pichi Richi camel safaris will have you looping out of Quorn through gorge country, encountering waterholes, wildlife and views with campfires, bush cooking and cold beers along the way. The Pichi Richi steam trains take you puffing through deep cuttings in the southern Flinders Ranges from Port Augusta to Quorn. Goldrush Ballooning offers a leisurely way to get aloft over Wilpena, with dawn views from the basket showing the land in a whole new light. The Outback Mail Run will have you playing postie for outlying cattle stations around William Creek. Contrast the desert with the rich waters of the Spencer Gulf on a cruise out of Port Augusta; dolphin encounters are pretty certain.

The wow and how of Wilpena Pound
''Wow'' is the easy bit: Wilpena Pound is a 17-kilometre-wide, saucer-shaped piece of planet looming out of the red desert. The rim of the saucer is ragged, bulging and provocative, a thing you can circle and climb; from vantages such as St Mary's Peak (a daunting 1170 metres up), you can see into the smooth depression (strangely calm by contrast) and out to the magnificent ranges all around. Wilpena Pound Resort and Rawnsley Park are perfectly placed to help you properly explore the compelling landform; their guides also have the time and patience to explain the ''how'' in terms of its formation.

The cradle of life
Fossils from the Ediacaran period found near Nilpena station in the 1990s proved primitive life forms were evolving much earlier than thought and the clocks of science had to be reset by hundreds of million of years. Four-wheel-drive tours out of the Prairie Hotel, the sign-posted self-drive tour through Brachina Gorge and the good folk at Arkaroola go a long way to explaining the complexities of this geological treasure house. To extract some not-unrelated insights, take the fascinating BHP surface tour at Olympic Dam, the world's biggest uranium and copper mine.
