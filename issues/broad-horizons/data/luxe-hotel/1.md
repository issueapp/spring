      A comfortable library with deep leather armchairs and a large stone fireplace provides some seclusion for enjoying a quiet drink and a good book, while dinner is hosted on the terrace overlooking the ranges. In the heat of summer, the swimming pool overlooking the Arkaba Creek is a welcome retreat after a morning or day spent exploring the bush.

      Your hosts will ensure a friendly and personal level of attention that is typically 'down to earth' but does not lose sight of the attention to the small details that are so important in delivering an outstanding outback experience. The real luxury at Arkaba comes in sharing this spectacular conservancy with just a handful of other guests.
