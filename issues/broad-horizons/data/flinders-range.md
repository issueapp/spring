    summary: The Flinders Rangers and Outback. Roads to somewhere ... afternoon drinks. It may be hard to define, but the rich history and stunning landscape of the outback provides an ideal backdrop for journeys of discovery, writes Max Anderson.

    <p>No line is painted on the road to indicate you are entering outback South Australia (please drive carefully). However, you know the outback when you see it.</p>

    <p>Open spaces under giant skies, ancient ranges that undo your sense of &#8221;now&#8221;, wide horizons riven by empty roads that lead to nowhere - until, that is, they arrive (rather surprisingly) at somewhere. What outback communities lack in population they make up for in colour, eccentricity and resourcefulness. They&#8217;re also rich in story, the very fabric of place: when the camera has taken its fill of ranges, waterholes and landforms, it&#8217;s the local people who add some of the landscape&#8217;s most meaningful layers.</p>

    <p>There is no line to indicate you are leaving outback South Australia (please come again). But once returned to your office, home or school, there&#8217;ll be no question where it was or what it was. You&#8217;ll be able to point to a map and say, &#8221;There - I found it there.&#8221;</p>

    <p>A 300-kilometre, two-day tour of the unsealed Oodnadatta Track is safe and surprising, with weirdness and wilderness aplenty. Start with Mutonia Sculpture Park near Marree (home of Plane Henge and Spinning Car - mildly deranged but compelling) then head into the yawning gibber plains. You&#8217;ll follow the remains of the first Ghan railway, where ruins of sidings and repeater stations for the overland telegraph line are dotted along a &#8221;string of springs&#8221;. </p>

    <p>Camp at Coward Springs, a delicious respite to wash off the dust in the hot mineral waters and barbecue under gums cackling with cockatoos. Stop to allow Lake Eyre South to boggle your eye and be sure to detour to the Mound Springs - these blisters in the plains are leaky ecosystems the size of houses that have evolved their own species of shrimp. Similarly unique species are at William Creek, especially at the famous pub; air tours over Lake Eyre are available with Wrightsair. Finish in Coober Pedy.</p>
