Qantas flights to Adelaide cost $106 for the 80-minute journey from Melbourne and $141 for the two-hour journey from Sydney. Virgin charges $59 from Melbourne and $94 from Sydney. If you adhere to the view that Port Augusta is the gateway, the outback starts after three hours' freeway driving north from Adelaide. Don't, however, underestimate the size of this region: there's another 4Â½-hour drive from Port Augusta to Coober Pedy, two hours to Parachilna or three hours to Arkaroola. The further you go the more notice you need to take of servo stops and road conditions.
Rental cars are available from the usual outlets at Adelaide airport, as well as Coober Pedy and Port Augusta.

Sharp Airlines flies daily from Adelaide to Port Augusta ($109 for a 50-minute flight); charter companies such as Ross Air can hop you around the outback, while Big Blue Air Touring can build - and host - your entire outback itinerary. Flying isn't cheap but the larger your party, the more cost-effective it becomes.
