Back in 1950 - when the average UK yearly salary was just over £100 and everyone was dancing to rock and roll - we made a little cheese triangle in fact, our little triangle is so famous you could say its an iconic brand of the UK!

And now, we’ve created our most dairylicious spread ever. So what’s in it, then? Cheese, butter, skimmed milk, sodium bicarbonate and lemon juice*. Yup, that’s it. All natural ingredients. All good. And all yummy. Which gives it that creamy-dreamy, unmistakable, Dairylea taste.

And, of course, as well as its dairyliciousnes, our cheese also comes in lots of brilliant shapes and sizes. Easy for you, fun for the kids.

Dairylea all natural is now made with skimmed milk (water and skimmed milk) (44%) cheese (34%) , butter, whey powder , concentrated lemon juice (from fresh lemons) , milk proteins, Stabiliser (sodium carbonate) to hold all the ingredients.
