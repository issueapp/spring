As the campaign is building we are already planning some BIG activity.

We’re launching the MUMMY HACK blog to aggregate all the great content that is useful to our audience of Mums. We can then publish this content back through our social channels to maximise our reach.
 
Promotional activities in leading retailers which will close the sales loop and drive in-store purchase – featuring Back to School lunch boxes complete with MUMMY HACK inserts.
 
And finally the launch of the MUMMY HACK card set & e-book. This will feature all the best MUMMY HACK content and be available for Mothers Day! The perfect gift for any Mum.
