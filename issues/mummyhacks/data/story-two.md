- Limited Budget
- no Awareness
- stagnant Category

DAIRYLEA was faced with an interesting challenge: replace KRAFT Kids Cheese products in the fridges of their Australian consumer.


Not only was a total rebrand and repacking job required, we needed to enter the market with a (very) limited budget, with no awareness into a category that was stagnant (and at time uninteresting).
