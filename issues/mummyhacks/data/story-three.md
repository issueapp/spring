In order to achieve our goals we partnered with Sapient Nitro. Together we developed an idea that was funny, helpful, had feeling and was useful for Mum (just the sort of information Aussie woman will share).

We needed to tap into the behaviours of Mum. We discovered what they were viewing, talking about or sharing and then went about developing a way in which we could join the conversation.

In order to fully take advantage of these conversations we partnered with Carat to build relationships with key influencer communities (including Mamamia & iVillage) & a wider blogger network. We then broadcast all of our content through Facebook to start the conversation in the platform that was used most frequently by Aussies Mums.
