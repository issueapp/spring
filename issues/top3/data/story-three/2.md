Peter Holmblad tried repeatedly to convince Arne Jacobsen to design something new for Stelton. He only succeeded, however, once he showed some of his own drawing to his stepfather. Arne Jacobsen found these so hopeless that he began designing something else. The brief was to create a tea and coffee service, as well as bowls, an ice bucket and pitchers for the dining table and bar - all in stainless steel.

Stelton launched the new products three years later as Cylinda-Line. The new series immediately made a splash as a major innovation within its category. The simplicity of cylindrical shapes and specially designed plastic handles characterized the line which, along with its brushed steel surfaces, stood in striking contrast to the highly polished curves of its day. Cylinda-Line was awarded the ID Prize in 1967.
