Arne Jacobsen (11 February 1902 – 24 March 1971)

Arne Emil Jacobsen, Hon. FAIA was a Danish architect and designer. He is remembered for his contribution to architectural Functionalism as well as for the worldwide success he enjoyed with simple but effective chair designs. He was one of the most influential Danish architects and designers of the 20th century.

His father Johan was a wholesale trader in safety pins and snap fasteners. His mother Pouline was a bank teller whose hobby was painting floral motifs

Arne Jacobsen put his modernist stamp on architecture and design for more than 50 years - not only in Denmark but also internationally. His output was enormous, originating in a philosophy of creating total concepts, where everything was thoroughly designed, with a common thread between the building, the furniture and other interior decor. This philosophy is evident in the Royal Hotel (1960) and Danmarks Nationalbank (the Danish central bank) (1971), for instance.

He was the ambitious individual who refused to compromise on quality and very much challenged his partners and manufacturers to create unique products.

Arne Jacobsen's productions are more relevant than ever - and have enjoyed a strong revival over the last 20 years. He embodies the balancing act of elite creator and household name.

Fun fact: Arne Jacobsen never used the word 'designer', notoriously disliking it.
