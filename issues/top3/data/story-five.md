After completing a degree in Industrial Design at UTS, Sydney based Goodrum went on to receive a Bombay Sapphire Design Discovery Award in 2005 for his Eve chair, and continues to create practical, well resolved and humorous products. Goodrum shot to fame after years of work on the now iconic stitch chair for Cappelini which went into production in 2008. He has recently been invited to judge a student competition at the Kortrijk XPO, an annual furniture exhibition in Belgium.
