After completing a degree in Industrial Design at UTS, Sydney based Goodrum went on to receive a Bombay Sapphire Design Discovery Award in 2005 for his Eve chair, and continues to create practical, well resolved and humourous products. Goodrum shot to fame after years of work on the now iconic stitch chair for Cappelini that went into production in 2008. He has recently been invited to judge a student competition at the Kortrijk XPO, an annual furniture exhibition in Belgium.

<b>1 - You are an Australian father, how many children?</b>

I am the lucky father of two little boys, five and nine years old.

<b>2 - What does a typical fathers day look like in your home? Any traditions?</b>

Breakfast in bed with vegemite toast by the boys if I’m lucky and a relaxing atmosphere of both indoor and outdoor activities. Oh and always a homemade card. These make me smile every year.

<b>3 - Your products have been exhibited in Italy, UK, Belgium, Japan. What cultural learning’s have you picked up along the way to inspire your work?</b>

I am constantly inspired by The Italians, they are so proud of their families. A sibling is present in almost every meeting I attend as they are being trained to take over the family business one day. It is a beautiful display of the passing down of skills. After the meetings, I am always asked back into their homes. Being proud of both your home and your family is a strong take-away.

<b>4 - What product have you recently helped to design in which children or families needed to be considered as key users? How did that influence the design?</b>

PlaySam is the leading Scandinavian Design Company for executive wooden toy gifts. Together with Top3, I designed a colourful mini race car made from wood. I know how much my son loves to open and close things so I designed the toy to inspire the notion of ‘play’. I always try to include an element of fun in my designs.

<b>5- What's your favourite family product experience inside your home?</b>

Cooking is deeply integrated into our home culture. The kitchen is a special space where lots of  sharing of stories and skills take place. The Kids chop carrots and set the table while we talk about what we all did and learned that day. It is this social interaction that inspired my design of the Timber Trivet for Normann Copenhagen.

<b>6 - What top3 item would be on the top of your father's day wish list?</b>

The Menu Flip Around Table/Chair. Beautiful craftsmanship with duel functionality - an honest reflection of Scandinavian Design.
