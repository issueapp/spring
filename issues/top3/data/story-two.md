NORM.ARCHITECTS was founded in 2008 and represents the vision of Jonas Bjerre-Poulsen and Kasper RÃ¸nn.

In spirit with the tradition for Scandinavian simplicity NORM strives to cut to the bone in their designs. To find the simplest shape for a given task without forgetting the beauty of the shape and the details, in order to reach a point where there is nothing to add and nothing to take away that can make the product better. Like true Scandinavians they pride themselves in their culture and history, and hope and aspire to create new norms for Nordic design.

They want their designs to not only be of good materials and good craftsmanship, but to embody beauty, history and, most importantly, outlive fleeting trends.
