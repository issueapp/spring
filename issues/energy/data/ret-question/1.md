### The landowner

Bill Garnock, landowner. Bill's property, Boco, sits in the middle of the <a href="http://gereports.com.au/post/11-12-2014/turbine-or-not-turbine-the-ret-is-the-question" target="_blank">Boco Rock Wind Farm</a> Farm, which began generating power in 2014. A long-time advocate of wind energy, Bill was set to host income-earning turbines on his property in stage two of the project, which is currently on hold. For now, his farm is home to a substation and transmission lines, but no turbines.

### GEreports: What did the operational RET, and certainty around the target, mean for you as a landowner with the prospect of hosting wind turbines on your property?

<b>Bill:</b> I’ve been here all my life. Our family has been here since the mid 1800s, so four or five generations. We farm cattle now, traditionally we were cattle and sheep but just cattle and wind now! My property is called Boco ...  our geographic situation lends itself to a wind farm, and being a believer in renewable energy resources, we were reasonably happy when the renewable-energy target came back in with the previous government. I've been chasing it [a wind farm in his district] to happen for 20 years. I think it’s a backwards step if [the renewable-energy target] disappears with this government. On our property, we've got the transmission lines … if stage two had gone ahead, then we could have 20-odd turbines.

There’s a lot of discussion around climate change, and whether it’s happening or not happening, and clean energy versus dirty, or whatever, without too much talk around the fact that these are renewable resources, they’re not finite resources. Once you get these things up and built ... the resources, such as wind, are free. There’s nothing you have to dig out of the ground and buy. So there’s a whole other side to the argument. Even though it might be more costly to establish the infrastructure, down the track, you’re dealing with a resource that’s free.

### The energy economist

John Quiggin, professor of economics at the University of Queensland, a member of the Climate Change Authority and author—most recently of award-winning book Zombie Politics: How Dead Ideas Still Walk Among Us [Princeton University Press]—frequently writes about energy economics, in the <a href="http://theconversation.com/only-a-mug-punter-would-bet-on-carbon-storage-over-renewables-35920" target="_blank">media</a> and on his <a href="http://johnquiggin.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>.

### GEreports: How important is the RET to Australia’s sustainable future?

<b>John:</b> It’s pretty clear that if we’re going to achieve a sustainable reduction in emissions there’s no alternative but to move entirely to renewable energy over the next 30 years or so. The only potential alternatives, neither of which I think will work, are nuclear energy, and carbon capture and storage.

Carbon sequestration doesn’t exist in any meaningful form. There are no examples of the full process; that is, carbon dioxide being captured from a power station and then sequestered. It’s a hypothetical technology. What we’ve seen, even in Australia, which has a strong incentive for it to work, is that funding has been greatly reduced.

As regards nuclear, it’s an open question what’s going to happen in the rest of the world, but really there’s no serious possibility of Australia having nuclear energy before, say, 2040. Even if you look back at the <a href="http://www.ansto.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/38975/Umpner_report_2006.pdf" target="_blank">Switkowski Report</a>, they were suggesting a minimum of 15 years [before nuclear power could come online], and that was really after a policy to introduce nuclear was in place, which takes quite a number of years. That ship has sailed for Australia.

The main point is, we need to reduce our CO2 emissions and we can’t do it without renewables. The other point is that the cost of renewables has come down so far that the impact they have on electricity prices is going to be exceptionally modest. The impact on the economy as a whole is going to be essentially undetectable over 30-35 years.

How should we get there [to being a country fueled by renewables]? The best option is probably a carbon price, but we’d need to have that higher even than it was under the original carbon-price scheme, and much higher than it’s likely to be in the near future. If we had a carbon price of $50 a tonne that applied across the entire economy, it would work better than a renewable energy target. Since the carbon price has been removed, the renewable energy target is the only game in town.
