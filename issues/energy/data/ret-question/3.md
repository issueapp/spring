### The renewables business chief

Alex Hewitt, managing director, CWP Renewables. Alex has worked in the wind sector for almost a decade in Australia, and before that ran utilities-development projects in Europe. He leads negotiations with project investors and the major suppliers of equipment, such as turbines.

### GEreports: How has the uncertainty around the RET affected your business?

<b>Alex</b>: We were prepared to wait for the six months for the review, and even six months of debate after that. But it’s dragging on, and as it drags on, that level of uncertainty means our business is in limbo. Shareholders are getting impatient … frustrated and impatient. Resources will be reduced if we don’t get a result soon.

We’ve got four projects. The next project is ready to build. If we had a RET, we’d be talking through power-purchase agreements with retailers, and we’d be financing the next project.

<blockquote>All projects across the renewable sector are now in limbo.</blockquote>

It takes five years to develop a project, and we invest in the order of $5 to $10 million, and that’s before construction starts. For the <a href="http://bocorockwindfarm.com.au/" target="_blank">Boco Rock project,&nbsp;</a>, we raised $360 million and we created hundreds of jobs. In order to make that investment happen, to make the project happen, you need two things. One is a project, and the other is legislation to underpin long-term confidence so that you can raise that money. Whilst there is that legislation in place you remain committed to your business. As soon as that’s taken away or even threatened, you’ve got to look very closely at whether you continue or not. In our case, if the RET is severely curtailed, we will not have a business. The moment the renewable energy target has bipartisan support, we continue with confidence.

We now have an on-off switch which will be determined by an outcome on the RET. There will be some dilution of the RET, but if we get a result in the 30s [thousands of gigawatt hours of renewable-energy generation] and there is some clearance of banked RECs [renewable energy certificates], then confidence returns, investment will come, and we’re full steam ahead. If this is still drifting around well into the second quarter, our investors are going to lose patience and our attentions will go elsewhere. Whilst this uncertainty continues, there won’t be any financing. I remain cautiously optimistic that we’ll get there, but it’s very frustrating. The last financing in the wind sector was Boco Rock in June 2013. Since the Abbott government came to power, our sector has been “closed for business”.

### The GE perspective

Jason Willoughby, managing director of sales and project finance for GE in Australia and New Zealand, works with GE customers to enable financing of infrastructure projects in many fields, from oil and gas extraction to wind-generated power.

### GEreports: What would RET certainty mean for Australia?

<b>Jason:</b> The energy sector at the moment is undergoing the most fundamental change that has been experienced in 100 years, and lot of that has been driven by the rapid development of technology. It’s very hard to look forward 20 years and be able to predict what the energy market will look like. The best way to prepare and get the most efficient outcome in the energy sector for Australia really comes down to policy certainty. So you set the framework, you step back and you let people compete.

GE looks at the RET as an important part of Australia’s overall environmental plan. There’s bipartisan support for reducing Australia’s emissions by 5% by 2020. The RET has been an important plank of the actions that have been implemented to achieve that 5% emissions reduction. Over the past 12 months, with the number of reviews, including the <a href="https://retreview.dpmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/RET_Review_Report.pdf" target="_blank">Warburton Review</a>, that have taken place, the conclusions have been quite clear that the RET reduces power prices over time, and that it also reduces emissions at the lowest possible cost. So the RET is achieving its primary objectives.

<a class="button outline hotspot" data-description='Dick Warburton, represented the "worst case scenario" and would cost thousands of jobs and more than $10 billion in investment if the government adopted its recommendations.' href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/dick-warburton-report-recommends-tony-abbott-slash-renewable-energy-target-20140828-109pih.html" data-action="Warburton Review">See Warburton Review</a>

That’s the context. Now, while there is uncertainty, investors are not going to be involved in the market. And if people aren’t expending the resources, aren’t spending the time to participate in the market, then you’re not going to get the best outcome for that market. You’re not going to get people innovating or competing, which I think is important to be able to come up with the best outcome.

GE’s position has been that when you introduce certainty to a market like the RET, then people will be encouraged to participate and that participation is going to provide innovation, competition and come out with the best possible solution. An opportunity exists for both major parties to collaborate, to ensure investment in Australia’s renewable sector can proceed with confidence. Compromise on both sides is manifestly in Australia’s national interest.
