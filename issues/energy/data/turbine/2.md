    <p>Boco Rock is CWP Renewables’ first wind farm development in NSW and is now owned by the Thai Electricity Generating Public Company, EGCO. Construction began in 2013, and has been delivered by a construction consortium comprising Downer and GE. It currently has 67 GE wind-turbine generators (WTGs): <a href="http://www.ge-energy.com/products_and_services/products/wind_turbines/ge_1.6_100_1.7_100_wind_turbine.jsp" target="_blank">58 of the turbines are 1.7-100 and nine are 1.6-100</a>, or 1.72 and 1.62 megawatts respectively. As it stands and spins today, the expected output from Boco Rock is 113.2 MW, enough to provide power to more than 50,000 households. A second phase of the wind farm is currently on hold pending the results of the <a href="http://www.environment.act.gov.au/energy/wind_power" target="_blank">ACT government wind auction</a>, in which Boco Rock Stage 2 is one of 18 projects competing to supply power to the ACT.</p>

His livelihood as a farmer has been transformed—saved, even—by hosting wind turbines.</p>
