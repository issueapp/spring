Children, their faces freshly painted by the busy artists in Kids Corner, are clutching activity books as they line up with their parents for the next bus to tour one of the day’s heroes: a gleaming new wind turbine generator, WTG No. 45 to be precise. Landowner Bill Garnock, whose family has been on the land here in southern New South Wales’s Monaro district since the mid 1850s, takes in the scene with a giant grin: “I’ve been chasing for this to happen for 20 years. So I think it's sensational.”

<p>Bill’s property Boco is in the middle of this brand new wind farm that is today welcoming the local community into its steadily rotating heart. Sixteen months after construction commenced <a href="http://bocorockwindfarm.com.au/" target="_blank">Boco Rock Wind Farm</a> is set to turn the local air currents into energy for the surrounding districts and beyond for at least the next quarter-century. Says Boco Bill: “Traditionally we were cattle and sheep, but we’re farming cattle and wind now!”</p>

<blockquote>“The economic and social gain that the area can get out of the turbines is going to be a benefit, so we've supported the development”</blockquote>

"The economic and social gain that the area can get out of the turbines is going to be a benefit, so we've supported the development," says fourth-generation district farmer and Bombala mayor Bob Stewart, who worked closely with the Boco partners to ensure that the oversize-load trucks bearing the giant turbine blades and towers from the Port of Eden could squeeze through his town and up to the site. Roads were widened, roundabouts too—even new bridges were built by the developers. “There's a return to the landowners for hosting the turbines, and there's a community fund … Bombala Council is the recipient of $77,500 a year, plus CPI, for the next 20 years,” says Bob. “We'll be able to get those smaller projects that community groups have been seeking, that we didn't have the financial capacity to do.” Cooma Council is also a  beneficiary of such payments, which are calculated on how many turbines each district hosts. In total, $167,500 will be paid each year to the two councils during the farm’s operation.
