<blockquote>This raises numerous, urgent questions as to the future of the energy network. One critical issue is how society can manage what exists more efficiently to fulfil current demand, without laying down more expensive infrastructure that potentially no one will be prepared to pay for.</blockquote>

Batteries used strategically to help manage load at different parts of the grid could be part of the solution. Distributing the load so that electricity feeds in from different points on the line to meet demand locally means that any point is not required to carry the full load at any time. The line will last longer and is less likely to need upgrading even if electricity demand increases.

Specialised software systems that manage energy distribution are another optimising solution.

Matt McKenzie, digital energy region leader for General Electric in the Asia Pacific, says utilities such as SP AusNet, City Power, Power Corp and Energex have already installed GE’s distribution management system (DMS). "It’s used by the control room to manage the electricity flow in the grid. It’s constantly monitoring grid assets so that you’re not overloading them; you’re switching loads around so that you’re making those assets last longer. It’s almost like a racing car driver not going too hard on the clutch so it doesn’t wear out.”

And like an iPhone, the DMS can include various specific optimising apps. Take the obviously named Fault Detection Isolation In A Storm app. Explains McKenzie: “It pinpoints where faults are occurring and the system then automatically calculates the best way to route power around the fault so that the minimum number of customers are offline for the minimum amount of time. That’s all done through sophisticated algorithms. Very, very different to where we were a few years ago, where people in control rooms had to make decisions about what to do.”

Calculating, self-regulating, fast decision-making software could also play a pivotal role in helping consumers to change their behaviour in a way that lowers peak demand. Says McKenzie, “If people were given a financial incentive to say, ‘Let’s have the air conditioner two degrees warmer than I’ve presently got’ … If that was all it took to avoid having to spend millions of dollars on a particular substation, people may very well take part in it.”

A surprising fact from Lucy Carter: “Air conditioners in Australia have to be capable of being remotely switched on and off. We’re not using this now, but it’s a built-in capability.”
