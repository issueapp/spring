<blockquote>This raises numerous, urgent questions as to the future of the energy network. One critical issue is how society can manage what exists more efficiently to fulfil current demand, without laying down more expensive infrastructure that potentially no one will be prepared to pay for.</blockquote>

Enter global warming, air conditioners and rooftop solar panels, and the need to optimise current electricity supply system has become urgent. As the recent Climate Council report, Australia’s Electricity Sector: Ageing, Inefficient and Unprepared, warned: “The electricity sector accounts for 33% of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions – the single biggest source of emissions.”

Such battery systems will allow consumers, small and large, to disconnect from the grid and will leave the costs of maintaining the grid itself to be distributed among fewer and fewer users.

Batteries used strategically to help manage load at different parts of the grid could be part of the solution. Distributing the load so that electricity feeds in from different points on the line to meet demand locally means that any point is not required to carry the full load at any time. The line will last longer and is less likely to need upgrading even if electricity demand increases.

Specialised software systems that manage energy distribution are another optimising solution.

Matt McKenzie, digital energy region leader for General Electric in the Asia Pacific, says utilities such as SP AusNet, City Power, Power Corp and Energex have already installed GE’s distribution management system (DMS). "It’s used by the control room to manage the electricity flow in the grid. It’s constantly monitoring grid assets so that you’re not overloading them; you’re switching loads around so that you’re making those assets last longer. It’s almost like a racing car driver not going too hard on the clutch so it doesn’t wear out.”

And like an iPhone, the DMS can include various specific optimising apps. Take the obviously named Fault Detection Isolation In A Storm app. Explains McKenzie: “It pinpoints where faults are occurring and the system then automatically calculates the best way to route power around the fault so that the minimum number of customers are offline for the minimum amount of time. That’s all done through sophisticated algorithms. Very, very different to where we were a few years ago, where people in control rooms had to make decisions about what to do.”

Calculating, self-regulating, fast decision-making software could also play a pivotal role in helping consumers to change their behaviour in a way that lowers peak demand. Says McKenzie, “If people were given a financial incentive to say, ‘Let’s have the air conditioner two degrees warmer than I’ve presently got’ … If that was all it took to avoid having to spend millions of dollars on a particular substation, people may very well take part in it.”

A surprising fact from Lucy Carter: “Air conditioners in Australia have to be capable of being remotely switched on and off. We’re not using this now, but it’s a built-in capability.”

Consumers could sign up to a reduced-cost energy scheme by ceding control of their air conditioners to their power company. Whether you think that’s cool may depend on whether you’re one of the millions of Australians who don’t have an air conditioner, but who are currently subsidising the cost of a grid built to cope with people who crank the air-con up to the max in summer.

As grid-management software gathers data to help regulate electricity flows and manage outages, it can also analyse that data in different ways. For example, x-number of power lines are cut by falling branches of trees of particular species every time there’s a wind of x-kilometres an hour or more. Many other data elements can be taken into account, until a data-management system is capable of directing crews to trim foliage, neither too much, nor too little for each species of tree, before those branches become a problem. It’s called “predictive maintenance”, says McKenzie.

“There are a lot of technology choices for industry stakeholders to make,” he says. “Without these sorts of technologies, you’d have to keep building the grid and managing the peak. Optimising the network and optimising the investment we make is the key to effectively powering growth in cities.”
