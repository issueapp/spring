To return briefly to batteries: Carter says the cost and size of viable batteries is also one of the factors stalling uptake of electric cars. Strategic placement of car-battery charging stations could be one way of managing electricity load and balancing the books – by bringing demand and payment for electricity a little closer to covering the cost of infrastructure.

“Electric vehicles are a big one here,” Carter explained in the Shock to the System seminar. "They’re a game changer fundamentally… Electric vehicles dramatically increase power consumption, but if they don’t come in for 10 years we’ve still got a big problem to solve.”

Optimising the use of the grid may hold the fort until the electric-car cavalry arrives, or perhaps technology will take society galloping energetically in another, as yet unforeseen, direction.
