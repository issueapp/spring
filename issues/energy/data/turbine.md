    title: Turbine or Not Turbine - That Is The RET Question
    summary: "The last Saturday in November is a warm one and the usually work-boots-only construction compound of Boco Rock Wind Farm is filled with visitors young and old. The ever-impressive women of the CWA are busy in a corner of the airy lunch room assembling mixed plates of a sandwich, half a jam-and-cream scone and a sliceâ€”a delicious bargain at $4. Nearby, Bella Cay is blowing out the candles on her 9th birthday cake, and homeschooling mother Nancy Groves is busy gathering information for a study unit devoted to renewable energy."
