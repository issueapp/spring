<blockquote>
  SHE ALWAYS HAD A LOT OF AMBITION AND TALENT. I ALWAYS TOLD KYM SHE WAS GOING TO RULE THE WORLD.
  <p class="author">- Former Russh editor Charlotte Scott</p>

At the heart of the fashion fairytale is the belief that its lead characters can come from anywhere. Coco Chanel’s father was a pedlar; Alexander McQueen, theson of a London cabbie. Here’s another to add to the list of mythological starters: “Dad drove one of those 200-metre-long road trains for days on end and back again. Mum used to make him sandwiches that were this tall [holds hands up to waist]. In photos of me as a kid, I’m sitting in the dirt in a T-shirt.”

Behold Kym Ellery of the eponymous Ellerylabel. Born in Perth and moved as a babe in arms to Karratha , Ellery is living proof that the fashion gene can emerge anywhere, even in a hard yakka mining town in the far north-west of Australia. I’d assumed she launched her own label eight years ago, at the age of 23, with a hefty loan from the bank of mum and dad. The truth behind many fashion fairytales, after all, is that uncle’s an entrepreneur or mum’s a corporate lawyer. Factor in that most evident of assets, beauty – and beauty is relevant when you embody your brand – and I had Ellery fi rmly in the charmed life box.

Who said fashion was meant to be fair? Actually, there was some parental bankrolling. Ellery’s dad Bruce, who now has his own concrete fl oor polishing business, kicked in $5000 at the get-go, topping it up to $20,000 over the label’s eight year life. Nice, but way short of what you need to stage events twice yearly during Paris FashionWeek, plus two more times a year in a swanky apartment in the 8th arrondissementso that buyers and journalists can see your creations up close. It’s at this apartment in Paris, sitting in old leather chairs on a polished parquet fl oor, that Ellery and I at last get to talk.

My mission: to see if she is, as her fans suggest, the one among the current crop of “it” Australian designers who will break the all too common boom-bust trajectory and really make it on the global stage. The one who will emerge with an international label whose geographic roots are barely mentioned, let alone commented upon. It’s a big ask but some think if anyone can do it, Kym Ellery can. “Ellery has that X factor,” says Kellie Hush, editor of Harper’s Bazaar in Australia. “Her designs appeal to the cool fashion girl as well as an international fashion lover who is looking for architectural design and quality. Kym also has this special marketing power in that she is a walking billboard for her brand. When she walks into a room, you want to have what she is wearing.”
