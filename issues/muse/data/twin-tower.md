<p><b>When Ursula Sullivan and Joanna Strumpf</b> set out to open an art gallery together in 2005, one of the first artists to sign up with them was Sydney Ball.  had some sage advice, as Sullivan (above, left) recalls: “He said don’t get a gallery space with big walls because your artists will paint big paintings and you won’t be able to sell them.”</p>
