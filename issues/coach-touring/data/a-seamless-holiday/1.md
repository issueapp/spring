Added considerations such as personal room preferences and dietary requirements are all part of the service, allowing travellers to throw away all cares and concentrate on life’s pleasures. Isn’t that what a holiday is all about?

Coaching delivers excellent value for money because of the economies of scale and bargaining power of coach companies. What’s more, some companies offer free return airport transfers, making it seamless to travel in New Zealand. Select companies also offer Australian Seniors Card holders discounts.

Coach companies provide guides on board throughout the trip so experiences are always personal, one-on-one and enjoyable. Expert guides ensure travellers’ safety and wellbeing, as well as being a repository of facts and figures on diverse regions. After all, conveying information that relates specifically to the locale being travelled through is a top agenda item for tour operators – and a major point of difference to independent touring.

This local “know-how” is the key to understanding how and why New Zealanders tick and subtle differences between our two nations that become intriguing. The information provided on board ensures that everything clicks.

Unlike cruising, a coach holiday offers a cross-country exploration in small numbers, as opposed to the large-scale release of tourists for a short period of time. Coach travel marries seamlessly with a suite of rail connections, boat trips, helicopter rides and any other means of exploring New Zealand as a whole.

Whilst the cruising industry trumpets the catch-cry “You only unpack once”, coach companies carry your bags for you, particularly for older travellers. Porters are on hand to carry baggage and other paraphernalia collected en route to and from the coach to your hotel room, safely and securely.

And then there’s that priceless interaction with fellow-coachers which is all part of the New Zealand coaching experience. Most coaches operate a daily rotation system, giving everyone an equal touring experience and the opportunity to interact and learn more about each other as the countryside flows by. It may emerge in conversation that the person sitting beside you enjoys horse-riding or wants to add a farm stay to the holiday after the coach tour. It may be a shared desire to experience a helicopter flight over Fiordland – and the result is a doubling of the enjoyment!

And then there’s the evening entertainment after a scenically-fabulous day coaching. This too is as bespoke as your lifestyle and tastes. Most nights see travellers sharing the day’s experiences over a glass or two of locally-brewed lager or wine, as recommended by the hotel and guide. Some bat on, while others opt for a restaurant of their choice for an up-close-and-personal dinner for two.

And speaking of pleasure, most coach companies include unforgettable specialty dinners which truly capture the Kiwi spirit and colour of New Zealand as part of the overall costs. These might include a traditional Māori hangi and concert in Rotorua.

Increasingly, coaching throughout New Zealand has become a personalised VIP experience. To accommodate this, there are options for smaller-sized groups, some reduced by half, whilst the coach size remain the same.

Each coach company provides a suite of different options - some of these additional extras include WiFi, options for solo travelers, extra leg room to move and specialty touches that raise the enjoyment threshold markedly.

Which all goes to explain the high incidence of repeat coach visitiors in New Zealand – and can you blame them?
