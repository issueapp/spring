<h3>ACROSS THE ALPS</h3>

Coach and train travel combine to deliver one of the world’s great scenic trips across New Zealand’s South Island Alps. The TranzAlpine/Arthur’s Pass train and coach route operates between Christchurch and Greymouth on the west coast.

From Christchurch, the TranzAlpine train crosses the lush, green patchwork farmland of the Canterbury plains, following the Waimakariri River and climbing into alpine scenery on a series of spectacular viaducts. “The Staircase” stands 73 metres above the river, while others have steel girder bridges over deep gorges and tunnels. After stopping at Arthur’s Pass amid mist-laden mountains, the train emerges from the 8.5km-long Otira Tunnel and proceeds to descend through sub-tropical rainforest and waterfalls, past beautiful Lake Brunner and old mining towns, terminating at coastal Greymouth.

From here, coaches leave from outside the station for destinations along the west coast and inland Queenstown on Lake Wakatipu. Coaches also depart from Arthur’s Pass and proceed to Hokitika, on the coast south of Greymouth, and the famed Franz Josef and Fox Glaciers. Rainforest, glaciers and the rugged coastline come together unlike any other place in the world, on the road from Haast to Hokitika. Around Hokitika, pounamu (greenstone) deposits along the west coast are visible while the coastal rock formations at Punakaiki, where rough surf surges through blow holes showering the famous Pancake Rocks.

Mighty mountains, rugged coast, glacial lakes and rainforest caused the West Coast to be named by Lonely Planet as one of the great road trips in the world, from Haast to Hokitika.

Westland is a wonderland of glaciers, coastline, mountains and forests of 1000-year old giant matai trees and rainforest canopy. To walk on the still-moving Franz Josef Glacier, first explored in 1865, is a stand-out experience. Soar above it and its twin, Fox Glacier, on a scenic flight to catch its true majesty.

Westland is one huge national park of forested terrain and alpine waterways, such as the Waiho River and Lake Manourika Wahapo. Its few towns reflect the early gold rush days and wildlife rules supreme, including endangered native species such as the small brown kiwi and Wapiti elk.
