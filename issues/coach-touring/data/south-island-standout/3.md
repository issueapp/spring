<h3>WEST COAST</h3>

North and south of Queenstown are two UNESCO wonderlands – Westland with its Franz Josef Glacier and Fiordland with Milford and Doubtful Sounds. However Queenstown itself is magnificent.

Perched on the shores of Lake Wakatipu, New Zealand’s second-largest lake, Queenstown has postcard appeal. Despite its “action” reputation, it offers less hard core, more mellow options - walking trails, onsen hot pools, spa treatments and traversing Lake Wakatipu on the 100 year-old coal-fired steamer “TSS Earnslaw”.

Queenstown also lies close to the centre of the world’s southernmost wine producing area – the Central Otago region. Its 30 vineyards include actor Sam Neill’s Two Paddocks vineyard as well as Kawarau Estate and Gibbston Valley.

Queenstown is an ideal base for exploring other wonders by scenic flight, such as Gibbston Valley, Vineyard and Skipper’s Canyon. Lake Quill, a helicopter experience from Queenstown, is close to the Sutherland Falls, New Zealand’s highest waterfall and the fifth highest in altitude in the world. Queenstown is the base for a walker’s paradise, including the iconic Milford, Routeburn, and Kepler Tracks, within the Fiordland National Park and Mount Aspiring National Park.

Beyond Queenstown, the Central Otago landscape unfolds – a true Middle-Earth experience. Arrowtown’s 19th century gold-mining history comes alive in the Lakes District Museum.

At the northern tip of Lake Wakatipu, 40 minutes from Queenstown, is rural Glenorchy. Paradise Valley, near the Mt Aspiring National Park and the towering Humbolt mountain range, was featured in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Further south, the stunning Fiordland region offers unspoilt scenery across 1.2 million hectares of World Heritage area including Mitre Peak, Doubtful Sound and Milford Sound. The latter was carved by glaciers during the Ice Ages, its cliffs, such as Caitlin Cliffs rising vertically. Waterfalls like Lady Bowen Falls cascade majestically from mountain peaks.

Milford Sound is only accessible by road via Te Anau. Visitors can board cruise boats to get up close and personal to such wonders as Mitre Peak and 160m-high Lady Bowen Falls and Stirling Falls. Boat cruises during the day or overnight are an excellent way to experience Milford Sound in all its grandeur. Some have underwater viewing observatories and all provide panoramic photo opportunities, such as fur seals sunbathing on rocks en-route. Scenic flights are another way of capturing the beauty.

Te Anau is the gateway to the glacier-carved Fiordland National Park, a kayaking, scuba diving and hiking paradise, from where you can explore the wonders of Milford Sound. Its museum covers both Māori and European history.

The coach ride to Milford Sound is in itself spectacular, through U-shaped valleys with crystal-clear lakes. Comfortable coaches collect you from your hotel in the morning and take you south, winding along the shores of Lake Wakatipu and across farmland. From there you venture deeper into the Fiordland National Park – with plenty of photo stops along the way – till you reach the Milford Sound Terminal. Once your cruise is complete, the coach returns, allowing a dining stop in Te Anau. A one-way trip usually takes about five hours.
