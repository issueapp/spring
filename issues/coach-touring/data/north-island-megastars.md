    <p><span class="highlight-letter">E</span>xplore the <b>Auckland</b> region, dotted with 48 volcanic cones and surrounded by rainforested hills, such as the Waitakere and Hunua Ranges. Visit Great Barrier Island, Hauraki Gulf, the Matakana Coast, the North Shore; Piha and Muriwai Beach and Waitakere. The beautiful food and wine mecca of Waiheke Island offers award-winning vineyards, gourmet restaurants and uncrowded beaches. Standing sentinel in the middle of Auckland Harbour, the volcanic island of Rangitoto was formed when it erupted 800 years ago. Today it offers walking tracks, solid lava caves and New Zealand’s largest pohutukawa forest.</p>

    <h3><span class="highlight-header">AUCKLAND</span></h3>

    <p>Guides from the local Tamaki Hikoi tribe provide cultural interpretation of Auckland’s traditional and contemporary Māori heritage. These intimate and engaging tours showcase some of Auckland’s iconic land features such as Maungawhau (Mount Eden) and the Auckland Domain, home of the Auckland Museum.</p>

    <p>Te Hana Te Ao Marama is an authentic marae and Māori cultural experience set in a remarkable 17th century Māori fortified pa and village replica. Take a guided tour for a fascinating glimpse into pre-European life and see the powerful and moving cultural concerts featuring traditional song and dance.</p>

    <p>Discover the way the sea has shaped New Zealand’s history and cultural identity at Voyager New Zealand Maritime Museum. The displays cover from the Polynesians’ epic sailing migration to Aotearoa, to European discoveries and settlement, to modern-day yachting success.</p>

    <p>Auckland pulsates with life and energy and nowhere is this more obvious than in its restaurant precinct and around its harbour shores (see pp 14-15).</p>

    <h3><span class="highlight-header">CENTRAL</span> NORTH ISLAND</h3>

    <p>The turbulent forces that formed New Zealand are most evident at <b>Rotorua</b> which sits squarely on the Pacific Rim of Fire and is the ancestral home of the Te Arawa people who settled here more than 600 years ago.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>Rotorua has one of the world’s most lively fields of geothermal activity.</p>

      <p>The recent discovery at Waimangu, south of Rotorua, of parts of the famed Pink and White Terraces – the so-called Eighth Wonder of the World, lost after the 1886 Tarawera Eruption – means an even better experience for visitors to the Rotorua and Taupo regions. Also not to be missed is Rotoroa Island, the Hauraki Gulf’s ‘newest’ island, recently opened to the public for the first time in 100 years, with rich social history, heritage buildings, walking trails, art and a modern exhibition centre telling the island’s fascinating story.</p>

      <p>There’s also Tikitere (Hell’s Gate) with its 20 hectares of mud pools, geysers, hot springs and the Southern Hemisphere’s biggest hot waterfall. Wai-O-Tapu has exhilarating mudpools, sulphur pool and the boisterous Lady Knox Geyser. North of Taupo are the famed Craters of the Moon. At Whakarewarewa is a traditional Māori village located alongside 500 hot springs and geothermal pools.</p>

      <p>At <b>Lake Taupo</b>, ride through The Timber Trail in the ancient forest, following two old logging tramways through some of the North Island’s most beautiful rivers, waterfalls and exotic forest. Swim in Kerosene Creek, south of Rotorua, and enjoy a gourmet lunch using geothermal steam at Te Puia, home of the famous Pohuto Geyser.</p>

    <h3><span class="highlight-header">EAST</span> COAST</h3>

    <p>Onemana Beach, on the Coromandel Peninsula, two hours’ drive from Auckland, lies a beautiful bay perfect for swimming, snorkelling and relaxing near the town of Whangamata, its crescent-shaped shore fringed by pohutukawa trees.</p>

    <p>The Lost World, located in the Waitomo Caves, is home to one of New Zealand’s most exciting caving adventures, leisurely boat rides or walks through caves with fascinating rock formations and glow worms.</p>

    <p>Northland is synonymous with stunning coastline, fishing, boating, arts and crafts along with fine food and wine. Among its main sights are the Waitangi Treaty Grounds near Paihia where the famous 1840 treaty signing took place. Visit the carved marae (meeting house) with its ceremonial canoe, the world’s largest. Tours and cultural performances bring this site alive.</p>

    <h3><span class="highlight-header">TOP</span> OF THE NORTH</h3>

    <p>Cruise the turquoise waters of the <b>Bay of Islands</b>, with whales and dolphins and explore it’s spectacular beaches fringed. This group of 144 islands at the north-east tip of New Zealand was the site of the first European contact. Today Northland is bursting with history and natural beauty in places such as Kerikeri, Waitangi, Opua and Paihia. Haruru Falls, Kawakawa and Kaikohe are also well worth a visit.</p>

    <p>The Puketi and Omahuta kauri forests, just north of the Bay of Islands, are in an almost untouched pre-colonisation state and native birds such as the kiwi, kokako and kaka are returning to their natural habitat. Further west is the Waipoua Kauri Forest, home of the Tane Mahuta, the 2000-year old “Lord of the Forest”, the largest living kauri tree in New Zealand.</p>

    <p>A Bay of Islands cruise takes in such sights as Cape Brett, Otehei Bay and Urupukapuka Island, the iconic Hole in the Rock, deserted beaches and secluded bays, all teeming with marine life.</p>

    <p>At Cape Reinga with its iconic 90-Mile Beach, the Tasman Sea meets the Pacific Ocean. It’s a Māori spiritual haven, where the spirits of the departed leap to begin the voyage back to their final resting place in the Pacific ancestral homeland.</p>

    <p>New Zealand is home to some of the most spectacular golf courses in the world, notably Kauri Cliffs, near Matauri Bay in Northland.</p>

    <h3><span class="highlight-header">WELLINGTON</span> REGION</h3>

    <p>To the south, the national capital, <b>Wellington</b>, is home to Te Papa, the National Museum of New Zealand, an extraordinary interactive museum of rich cultural history. Discover Wellington’s bygone days at the Colonial Cottage Museum (which also happens to be Wellington’s oldest original cottage), famed New Zealand writer Katherine Mansfield’s birthplace and explore its oldest suburb, Thorndon, with its quaint cafés.</p>

    <p>Filmmakers Sir Peter Jackson and others have turned the eastern suburb of Miramar into “Wellywood”, a filmmaking, post-production and special effects infrastructure precinct, featured in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Avatar.</p>

    <p>Wellington’s café culture buzzes and the city has more cafés per capita than New York. Foodies will enjoy fine dining and seriously cool bars along the waterfront and in eclectic Cuba Street, Courtenay Place and its bars and Oriental Parade, home to Sunday City and Harbourside Markets.</p>

    <p>Kapiti Coast is the getaway for Wellington residents and tourists alike. Kapiti Island and the surf of Palliser Bay are justifiably famous. Along the south coast is a large seal colony and Cape Palliser Lighthouse.</p>

    <p>The vineyards of Wairarapa, an hour from Wellington, including Martinborough, Featherston, Greytown, Carterton and Masterton, produce premium wines, especially Pinot Noir, which complement country cooking and haute cuisine. A day visit should include viewing the rare white kiwi at Pukaha Mount Bruce or visiting the region’s only working brewery at Mangatainoka. At Palliser Bay with its lighthouse, view fur seals, the perfect complement to a visit to Wellington.</p>

    <h3>NATIONAL <span class="highlight-header">PARKS</span></h3>

    <p>Visiting the North Island’s National Parks is a must. In 1894, Tongariro became the fourth national park to be established in the world, after Yellowstone National Park in the USA. Around its central volcano, Ngaurahoe, explore herb fields and forests, tranquil lakes and even desert-like plateaus. Another North Island National Park, Egmont in Taranaki, was founded in 1900.</p>

    <p>In 1993 Tongariro National Park, in the central North Island, became the first area to be inscribed on the World Heritage List under the revised criteria encompassing cultural landscapes. The mountains at the heart of the park hold cultural and religious significance for Māori people, and symbolise the spiritual links between them and the environment.</p>
