Whether it be a smart restaurant in Auckland’s Viaduct or Wellington’s hip Cuba Quarter or a Hokitika “fayre café”, the gastronomic experience is always unforgettable in The Land of the Long White Cloud – or, rather “The Land of the Long White Wine”.

New Zealand is a cornucopia of fresh, local produce and touring throughout is all about discovering exciting local gastronomic and beverage pairings – and celebrating!

New Zealand wines have not only taken the world by storm but have also paired up with inspired, quirky Fusion Cuisine, both derived from A-grade local produce based upon spectacular climate, soils and terrain. New Zealand dairy produce accounts for a third of the global dairy trade, accompanied by world-famous lamb, beef, venison and seafood, notably salmon and blue cod. The world cannot get enough of delicious New Zealand blueberries teamed with a local blue cheese.

The Marlborough vineyards and their epicentre, the Wairau Valley, not only produce world-famous sauvignon blanc. Its restaurants and boutique producers are celebrated for enticing cuisine, particularly seafood.

Sample local produce from the farm gate or the Sunday Marlborough farmers’ market. And what better way to enjoy a magical Marlborough Sounds cruise or fishing trip than with fine food and wine?

Further south, The Remarkables Market in Queenstown, held every Saturday from late-October to mid-April, specialises in organic food. Somewhat off the beaten plate is the Hokitika Wildfoods Festival, the annual creative “fayre” celebration held each March in Westland on the South Island.

<h3>WINE</h3>

The first vines in New Zealand were planted in the Bay of Islands by the missionary, Reverend Samuel Marsden in 1819. Migrants arrived in Northland in the late 1800s, bringing their European tradition of winemaking. The foundation of the New Zealand wine industry, many of today’s successful wine companies trace their lineage back to Northland.

Sauvignon Blanc, the most widely planted varietal, was first made in commercial quantities in 1979. Early success at local and international wine competitions meant that by the early 1990s, Sauvignon Blanc was firmly established as New Zealand’s flagship wine.

New Zealand provides a synergy of climate and soil which is ideal for grape growing. Vineyards are to be found on both islands, each microclimate producing a distinctive taste. For example, the vineyards of Central Otago, near Dunedin, are New Zealand’s highest and the world’s most southern wine region. Ringed by spectacular mountains and crossed by river gorges and lakes, with deep glacial soils composed of heavy clays and schist, the vineyards are ideally suited to pinot noir (80%). White varieties including riesling, chardonnay and pinot gris are also grown.

The Marlborough region near Blenheim, and its epicentre, the Wairau Valley, have become synonymous with sauvignon blanc. There are a staggering 17,830 hectares under sauvignon blanc grapes, the closest other variety being 2400 under pinot noir. Marlborough’s 100 wineries, including nearly 40 cellar doors, are responsible for 72% of New Zealand’s total wine production.

New Zealand’s second largest wine region, Hawke’s Bay, near art deco Napier, has been an abundant source of fine wine since 1851. Today its many artisan producers enjoy an international reputation for producing fine wines, including Bordeaux-blend reds, Chardonnay and Syrah. The Gimblett Gravels produce particularly fine wine. Hawke’s Bay is home to an outstanding wine tourism culture and offers a wide variety of cellar door experiences as well as amazing food and wine events throughout the year.

Vineyards abound in the Waikato region near Auckland and the Bay of Plenty and there are wineries on Waiheke Island in Auckland harbour, 30 minutes by boat from the city. Martinborough, about 90 minutes’ drive from Wellington, has become famous for its Pinot Noir, making it a tourist destination for foodies and wine devotees alike.

<h3>CUISINE</h3>

The unique New Zealand cuisine, often termed “Pacific Rim”, results from chefs’ ability to create delectable dishes based on the fresh regional selection of ingredients.

King Salmon is revered, its flavour and freshness reflecting the cool, deep waters off the South Island. Treatments include salmon tartare, wood-roasted salmon, cold smoked salmon and alpine salmon. Apart from salmon, there are crayfish (lobster), Bluff oysters, paua (abalone), pipis, scallops and mussels.

Seared venison loin (cervena) is famous from Oamaru (North Otago) and the Waitaki District, another “foodie” destination. As for lamb, it assumes celebrity status in Hawke’s Bay.

From Central Otago, around Dunedin, come Gibbston Valley cheeses and free-range Southland-based Kapuka Pork and other Wakatipu regional delights, all perfect with a local classic pinot noir. Kumara (sweet potato), kiwifruit and tamarillo are other distinct flavours.

Celebrated New Zealand executive chefs such as Peter Thornley of Hilton Queenstown restaurant Wakatipu Grill and Peter Gordon of Auckland’s Sky Tower restaurant (on level 53, the tallest building overlooking Federal Street Dining Precinct) join other top names including Michelin-star chef Josh Emett (who worked as Gordon Ramsay’s head chef at London’s Savoy Grill) who now cooks up a storm at Rata restaurant in Queenstown. Other famous restaurants include Kerikeri’s award-winning Pear Tree, The Lodge at Kauri Cliffs and Boulcott Restaurant in Wellington. Auckland’s Federal Street Dining Precinct includes Depot Eatery and Oyster Bar for succulent seafood, The Grill by Sean Connolly for steaks extraordinaire and Masu for the best Japanese as well as a most entertaining open-plan kitchen.

<h3>WILD WACKY ‘FAYRE’</h3>

In a category of its own is Hokitika in Westland for perhaps the greatest “foodie” success – based on grubs and larvae! With its stunning natural panoramas of seascapes, mountains and rainforests and an abundance of native trees and wildlife, the small town of Hokitika, has become a “must” on the culinary map, thanks to creative foodies who have a taste for wild “fayre”. In 1990, local Claire Bryant teamed her home brew, made from rose petals and gorse flowers, with other local food delights such as fritters, sushi, kebabs and ice cream, all made from such “delicacies” as huhu grubs, locusts and worms lavae, sheep’s testicles, grasshoppers, paua, punga fern and more – and it proved a great success known as the Hokitika Wildfoods Festival.

This wild and wacky food festival each March attracts up to 15,000 intrepid gourmets all seeking that certain something a little bit different. Over the past 24 years it has evolved into one of the quirkiest food events in the world – a gastronomic celebration of the tasty, wild but slightly weird foods harvested from the lush forests and waterways. It’s listed as one of Frommers’ 300 ‘unmissable festivals and events around the world’.

The quirky menu includes off-the-beaten-track items, such as sea scallop kebabs, wild pork sausages and bacon, spit roast venison, tasty paua/abalone patties, kina/sea egg shots, marinated tuna, smoked garlic seared whitebait, whitebait patties, whalebait, and deep-fried shark as well as pukeko/swamp hen, smoked river trout and paradise duck. For the intrepid there are snails, seagull eggs, grasshoppers, mountain oysters, and a choice of huhu beetle grubs served live, cooked, or chocolate-coated! To wash down such delicacies, there is Monteith’s beer, not to mention rhubarb, rose petal and elderflower bubbly, honey mead, kowlua, milk and local moonshine.
