The “wow” factor extends across Cook Strait to more A-List destinations.
The South Island, the larger of the two major islands, has an area of 150,460km2 and is less densely populated.

A palette of dramatic scenes, New Zealand’s South Island hosts the purest natural landscapes you’ll ever experience. Showcasing the best of nature’s assets where towering alps meet peaceful sounds and rugged coastlines merge with sweeping plains.

<h3>EAST COAST</h3>

Marlborough wine region is responsible for 72% of New Zealand’s total wine produce, with over 100 wineries in the region, there’s rarely a dry moment at its popular restaurants and boutique producers, with delicious seafood the perfect accompaniment.

Visit at least one of the 38 cellar doors to taste award-winning wines and sample local produce from the farm gate. On Sundays visit the Marlborough Farmer’s Market. The exploits of pioneer aviation heroes of World War I are brought to life by Weta Workshop, of The Lord of the Rings and Avatar fame at the Omaka Aviation Heritage Centre.

En route to Christchurch, Kaikoura (Māori for “meal of crayfish”) is an eco-tourism jewel. A two kilometre-deep canyon stretches along the ocean floor, creating a rare system of sea currents which service a large marine food chain – particularly sperm whales, dusky dolphins, orcas and fur seals. The prolific offshore wildlife and visitors to this magnificent coastal environment enjoy dining on fresh local catch, including crayfish and green-lipped mussels.

Its humble whaling and fishing origins have spawned global fame for observing the abundant wildlife off Ohau Point, as well as albatross watching and swimming with dolphins.

The restorative work at Christchurch and its rejuvenation is inspiring, especially initiatives such as Gap Filler and Re:START Mall. Enjoy a glass of local wine in a shipping container or restaurant in a bus. Wherever you are, Christchurch has enormous appeal.

Christchurch is the starting point for the TranzAlpine, one of the world’s great train journeys over the Southern Alps. The Canterbury Plains stretch out from Christchurch, its lush pastures and vineyards overlooked in the far distance by omnipresent Aoraki/Mt Cook, the “cloud piercer”.

The township of Lake Tekapo, three hours drive south-west of Christchurch in the Mackenzie Basin, faces north across the remarkable turquoise-coloured waters to the mountainous drama of the Southern Alps. Lake Tekapo gets its unique colour from the fine rock-flour ground by glaciers, suspended in the water. The altar window of the beautiful Church of the Good Shepherd, built in 1935 for the pioneer families of the Mackenzie district, frames a perfect photo view of Aoraki/Mount Cook.

Further south of Christchurch is Central Otago, often referred to as the eco-capital of New Zealand. A region of natural beauty overlaid with a fascinating cultural history, it stretches from the Waitaki district, north of Oamaru with its fishing villages and green pastures, to the mighty Clutha River south of Dunedin.

The whitestone townscape of Oamaru contains some of the best-preserved heritage buildings in New Zealand, reflecting its late 19th century prosperity from goldmining, quarrying and timber milling. Elegant stone buildings made from local limestone are best seen in the Harbour-Tyne Street area and the public gardens include a Victorian summerhouse.

Oamaru has another claim to fame. Its harbour is home to a colony of little blue penguins and even yellow-eyed penguins observed from a special hide. Penguin viewing is best just before sunset when they waddle ashore for the night. 

The nearby Waitaki Valley is one of New Zealand’s newest wine regions, its cool climate and limestone soil producing world-renowned pinot noir and riesling.

Surrounded by dramatic hills and at the foot of a long harbour, Dunedin is one of the best-preserved Victorian and Edwardian cities in the Southern Hemisphere. Known as the Edinburgh of the South, it wears its Scottish heritage with pride. Until 1881 it was the country’s largest city and the legacy of the city’s gold-rush affluence is its many impressive buildings, including Larnach Castle and First Church, designed by one of New Zealand’s most eminent architects, R.A.Lawson. Other prominent buildings include the Dunedin Railway Station, Captain Cook Tavern, Speight’s Brewery and the Cadbury Chocolate Factory. Baldwin Street is claimed to be the world’s steepest street where the famous Cadbury Jaffa Race is held. A kiwi favourite, Jaffas are balls of orange sugar-coated chocolate that hurtle their way down this steep street.

Dunedin is also a centre for ecotourism. The world’s only mainland Royal Albatross colony is at Taiaroa Head and several penguin and seal colonies lie within the city boundaries on the Otago Peninsula. To the south, on the western side of Lake Waihola are the Sinclair Wetlands and the mysterious Moeraki boulders on the Otago Coast.
Head further south, and you join the Southern Scenic Route that follows the wild coast down to Invercargill and then north-west to Manapouri and Te Anau.
