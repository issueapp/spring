New Zealand is our first cousin – our closest mates unless we’re talking rugby. Getting to know the country up-close and personal becomes a truly enriching experience, and it’s not only from chatting to locals en route.

Coach is certainly an easy way to travel in New Zealand – one price covers accommodation, most meals, airfares, taxes, and transfers – plus the all-important comprehensive sightseeing - and several unforgettable specialty evenings.
