Whakairo (Māori carvings) each represent a unique narrative passed down through generations explaining tribal history. Traditionally Māori carvers were men, their craft including precious adornments, weapons, tools, musical instruments, canoes and decorative panels and posts for village buildings.

Carved ornaments, including pendants, breast pendants and combs, were made from pounamu (jade or greenstone), whale ivory and whale bone. Symbols include the tiki, which represents the human figure, and the manaia, a creature with bird-like head and serpent-like body, associated with guardianship. Traditional carving patterns were inspired by nature, including spider webs, fish scales and ferns. To see historic Māori art pieces, visit Te Puia in Rotorua, Wellington’s Te Papa and the Auckland Museum.

<h3>Māori Etiquette:</h3>

The marae is central to the Māori community. Most important of its buildings is the wharenui or carved meeting house which usually represents an ancestor of the tribe.

The tekoteko (carved figure) on the roof top in front of the house represents the head, and the maihi (front barge boards) are the arms held out in welcome to visitors. Many wharenui contain intricate carvings that refer to the whakapapa (genealogy) of the tribe and to Māori legends.

If you are lucky enough to step inside a wharenui, remember to remove your shoes and always seek permission before taking photos. The manuhiri (guest) cannot walk on to the marae without being formally welcomed with a pōwhiri by the people of that place, beginning with a wero (challenge). A warrior may carry a taiaha (spear-like weapon), and will lay down a token – often a small branch – for the visitors to pick up to show they come in peace. Visitors walk onto the marae as a group, slowly and silently with the men in front of the women. They pause along the way to remember their ancestors who have passed on. Guests and hosts take their seats facing each other and speeches are made. To cap off formal proceedings, visitors and hosts greet each other with a hongi – the ceremonial touching of noses. After the pōwhiri, kai (food) is shared, in keeping with the Māori tradition of hospitality.

Take part in a pōwhiri at such locations as Northland (Waitangi Treaty Grounds); Auckland (Te Hana, Te Ao Marama, one hour north of Auckland); Rotorua (Te Puia, Tamaki Māori Village, Whakarewarewa Thermal Village and Mitai Māori Village); Hawke’s Bay (Waimarama Māori Tours) and Christchuch (Ko Tane).
