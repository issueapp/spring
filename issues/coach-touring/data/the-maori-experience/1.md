Central to New Zealand’s national cultural identity, Māori constitute 15% of the population, second only to those of European extract, Pakeha. Te Reo (the Māori language) is undergoing a resurgence. Colourful Māori traditions form an integral part of New Zealand nationalism and an unforgettable tourist attraction.

Legend has it that Kupe arrived in Aotearoa in his waka hourua (sailing canoe), making landfall at Hokianga Harbour in Northland 1000 years ago. Others followed and today, iwi (tribes) trace their forebears to seven main waka (canoes). Nature is central to Māori legends, such as the 2000 year-old kauri forests of Waipoua on the North Island’s northwestern coast. Visitors can hear Māori legends of the forest, its gods and inhabitants, and experience Māori guides greeting the giant trees with spine-tingling waiata (sacred songs).

Rotorua is at the epicentre of Māori culture where two Romeo and Juliet lovers, Hinemoa and Tutanekai, were forbidden lovers. This rich spiritual history unfolds amid Rotorua’s bubbling thermal springs on the island of Mokoia in Lake Rotorua. To this day, members of the local Te Arawa tribe and decendents of this union tell their story and soak in Hinemoa’s Pool, the natural hot spring where she bathed, awaiting her lover.

The Māori culture is one in harmony with nature – its ocean, rivers, forests and wildlife. This is evidenced in day-to-day traditional living that included ancient styles of hunting and fishing using harakeke (fishing nets woven from flax) and carved fishhooks from bone and stone. The marae (meeting area) is both a communal and sacred place with social and religious significance in Māori society. Upon arrival visitors are always greeted by a pōwhiri (traditional welcome ceremony) conducted by Māori warriors brandishing spear-like taiaha and mere (club) before being invited to enter. The strategically-located pa (fortified village) with defensive stockade and trench – so vital in past war situations – can also be experienced today.

Many tourist operators organise traditional Māori hangi (earth oven) and concert experiences. These usually include a visit to a marae and include pōwhiri including the famous hongi followed by a meal of delicious Māori food cooked in hangi. Another highlight is the group performance of rhythmic poi dancing and harmonious singing, followed by a ferocious haka (war dance).

The total experience is unforgettable.

Other cultural experiences include displays of visual arts such as carving, weaving and ta moko (tattooing), as well as exhibitions of precious adornments and traditional weapons, usually in greenstone jade, in museums and at cultural centres on both islands.

Māori history is inextricably bound to the sea. Legend tells the story of the ancestor Paikea who journeyed to New Zealand on the back of the whale Tohorā, emphasising once again, the spiritual bond between the Māori and natural worlds which inspired Witi Ihimaera’s book Whale Rider and the award-winning film. Off the Kaikoura Coast in the South Island, the local Māori people take visitors to see majestic whales. Visitors feel a palpable sense of the connection between the Māori and the sea.

Rotorua is one place where the turbulent natural forces that formed New Zealand are most evident. This city, on the volcanic plateau, has one of the world’s most lively fields of geothermal activity, complete with hot springs and boiling mud pools. It’s no wonder the local Māori people settled here over 800 years ago. Visit bubbling orange hot pools, marvel at geysers erupting 30m into the air, and take a scenic flight to New Zealand’s only active marine volcano, White Island. Once you finish sightseeing, soak tired bodies in geothermal mud baths and natural hot springs.

It’s never been a better time to rediscover some of the Rotorua and Taupo regions’ most famous geothermal attractions, including Wai-O-Tapu with its exhilarating mud pools, sulphur pools and geysers, one known as Lady Knox. The stunning Champagne Pool is unforgettable.

The ominous-sounding Hell’s Gate  geothermal park covering 20 hectares includes the Southern Hemisphere’s largest hot-water waterfall. Just north of Taupo is a geothermal walk known as Craters of the Moon while Whakarewarewa boasts a traditional Māori village as well as 500 hot springs, terraces and pools. Meaning “black water” in Māori, Waimangu, south of Rotorua, is a thermal area that was created after the devastating 1886 Tarawera Eruption – the same eruption that buried the then ‘Eighth Wonder of the World’, the Pink and White Terraces.

<h3>HANGI CUISINE</h3>

Traditional Māori cuisine is prepared in an earth oven. Earth is scraped away from the hangi pit to reveal baskets of hot stone-cooked food. Parcels of food wrapped in leaves are cooked over white-hot volcanic rocks which retain the heat.

Distinctive Māori flavours used in hangi cooking include horopito (pepper); kawa kawa (bush basil) and koura
(freshwater crayfish).

Experience a hangi at Whakarewarewa Thermal Village, Te Puia and in Rotorua.
