More than just your wardrobe essential, denim is the hardest-working material as it transcends both fashion and time. With the likes of James Dean, Farrah Fawcett and Alexa Chung sporting the cotton twill material, it’s not just a piece of clothing, it’s a statement.
 
Blowing up from the old-school American film stage to the modern music scene, it has reshaped and redefined itself through each era, becoming central to pop-culture as we know it.
