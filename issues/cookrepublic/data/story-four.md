## Notes

As a rule of thumb, add no more than 8 to 9 ingredients in order to draw the maximum flavour of one star ingredient in the recipe.  
Use frozen fruit. Once a week, prepare smoothie packs of chopped fruit in ziplock bags. Freeze.
Use ice cubes if you don’t have frozen fruit.
Sneak in healthy ingredients you would never dare to eat on their own. Avocado? Kale? Seriously overripe banana?
Do have a mid morning "real" breakfast of eggs maybe? Protein is vital.

 
You can add as many ingredients as you want. Once you start experimenting, you will figure out which flavours compliment each other well. And remember to have fun! Before you know it, your body will crave the goodness of all these beautiful ingredients even before breakfast.
