 For 8 years, I worked day and night on a single steel bench overflowing with kitchen paraphernalia, food, portable cooktop and very little working space. The barely functioning kitchen housed an old oven, a leaking sink, sunken and peeling countertops and basically served as a large mustard storage space. And I had fun with those limited resources testing recipes for my blog, writing a cookbook and developing new flavours for clients. Because I knew someday we would save enough to change it all. Then I won a $30,000 kitchen makeover by the Good Guys at Kidspotâ€™s Voices Of 2013 event in November last year. And everything changed!

With an amount so generous, we decided to fast track our renovations and so began what would become a six-month-and-ongoing exercise to create a beautiful space for our family and for my work. Our old kitchen was in the centre of the house with extensions to the house radiating off it. I wanted the kitchen to be close to windows and the outer wall of the house. Our home is close to 60 years old and had dark wood panelling on the walls, a patchwork of rose hued carpet, slate tiles and parquetry flooring flowing throughout. We also had all these walls and openings creating unnecessary nooks and stealing all the light and usable space. Knocking down walls and making it open plan was one of the first things our builder did. We wanted to retain all that gorgeous light in our family room (that I used as my kitchen/study/studio). So we made one of the best decisions we have which was to build a low lying kitchen with massive counters/island and not have any cupboards or storage overhead. Which meant, we could have beautiful long windows running along the length of the 6 meter long counter.
 
Our old space had metal and glass doors, reminiscent of the French industrial era; the kind you would find in an old factory or warehouse. We wanted to carry that look through our renovation. We spent hours configuring the most perfect set of windows with bold black bars that were dynamic and changed the look just by sliding and creating an entirely new configuration.   We pulled up our old timber floor boards and lay down wide oak planks with gorgeous wood knots and grain detailing.
