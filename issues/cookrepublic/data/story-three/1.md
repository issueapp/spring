## My addiction.

It made me feel voracious and larger than life. It felt indulgent and smooth and dark and sweet and consuming. When I was done, I felt satisfied and nourished. Like being bear hugged from behind and being swept off my feet (by him!). It felt almost that good.

## The smoothie.

Every single day. Before breakfast.

For a while now since I got my Vitamix, I have been creating smoothies. What started out as a couple of times every week, has now become my daily ritual. My addiction. It grew when I realised that I could go to town and get really creative with the smoothies. After the initial excitement of tossing random things in the jug of the blender and figuring out that they tasted great no matter what, I started getting serious with my daily concoctions.

I consume very little sugar. Six years ago I cut back copious amounts of sugar from my diet, switched to more natural and wholefoods and started running. I eventually lost 22 kilos in the space of two years and have managed to keep it off. I do not take sugar in my tea, coffee or cereal. I rarely ever have dessert (I am a savoury girl!). So I make an exception in my smoothies. With a fruit and vegetable base, my smoothies will often have mango or banana which provides me with the sugar my body craves to charge through the morning. Spinach, celery, raspberries, blueberries, orange or pineapple will provide the supporting act to the star fruit. Oats are a constant fixture. As are nuts. I skip conventional dairy and opt for soy milk, almond milk and coconut water to thin the smoothies. Ginger and turmeric have been immensely valuable in my quest to heal the body from within. The fancy (and expensive) additives often include Maca powder, Acai berry powder, cacao nibs, matcha, wheatgrass powder, probiotic powder and protein powder. I ought to have a mobile smoothie lab with little glass containers filled with everything from exotic to mundane. I can picture myself rolling up my hypothetical sleeves and dropping in a spoonful of this and a drop of that like a modern day smoothie witch.
