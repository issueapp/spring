Today’s smoothie is an ode to today. Valentine’s Day. Not the day that guilts you into buying overpriced flowers and boxes of chocolates. But a day dedicated to the single greatest  thing that makes this world go around (besides physics!) – love. If you want to know where Valentine’s Day originated and it’s symbolism, go read the Wiki. For me, it is just another day with a few add-ons and flourishes. A day to hug your loved ones just a bit more tighter and longer. A day to look at love with fresh eyes (did you notice that the raspberry looks like a heart?). A day to step outside the ordinary, take a page off Ashley Rodriguez’s brilliant concept and go on a date with my husband – at home. Today, we are celebrating our 19th Valentine’s Day together. And I made him a special aphrodisiac laced smoothie that has one of his favourite words in it. Cacao. It cracks him up. Every single time. His amusement makes me smile. Every single time I hear him parrot it like a macaw.
 
Sometimes it feels like only yesterday that we met, all fresh faced and giddy in love. And then on other days when I wake up next to him every morning and he has hit the snooze button for the second time, I lie there and look at his peaceful face; wakefulness still evading him. I look at the lines on his face  and an entire lifetime flashes through my head. In that instant, I realise that I just can’t remember the time before I met him. Over almost two decades, I have loved him and have grown into the person I am because of him and his love. I am thankful for it. So today, I wish you all love. Because there is someone or something to love. There is life. It is precious. Never stop looking at it with fresh eyes!
