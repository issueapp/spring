## Code Review

ContentView

 1. ContentView#fetchNext does too much, it should simply fetch a new page
 2. image protocol should be part of json resource
 3. It doesn't go backward

Cover page 

 1. it needs better picture
 2. it should support swipe action
 3. it should be a reusable view.

Menu

 1. We only have men/women category for now, there isn't enough channels for other categories
 2. Visual distinction between a live stream and a separate issue
